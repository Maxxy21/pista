# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 🔐 Environment Security
- **Created secure `.env.example` template** with placeholder values
- **Verified `.env.local` is properly gitignored** (not in repository)
- **Environment variables are now properly secured**

### 🔒 API Route Authentication
- **Created comprehensive authentication middleware** (`src/lib/auth/api-auth.ts`)
- **Protected all API routes** with `withAuth()` wrapper:
  - `/api/transcribe` - Audio transcription endpoint
  - `/api/evaluate` - Pitch evaluation endpoint  
  - `/api/generate-questions` - Question generation endpoint
  - `/api/evaluate-answers` - Answer evaluation endpoint

### ✅ Input Validation
- **Implemented Zod schemas** for all API routes
- **Server-side validation** for all request payloads
- **Comprehensive error handling** with validation details

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
- **Created flexible rate limiter** (`src/lib/rate-limit/rate-limiter.ts`)
- **Applied different limits** per endpoint type:
  - Transcription: 10 requests/minute
  - Evaluation: 20 requests/minute  
  - Other APIs: 50 requests/minute
- **Rate limit headers** included in responses

### 🛡️ Security Headers & CSP
- **Content Security Policy** implemented with appropriate directives
- **Security headers middleware** (`src/lib/security/headers.ts`)
- **Updated middleware.ts** to apply headers to all responses
- Headers include: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

### 📁 File Validation
- **Comprehensive file validator** (`src/lib/validation/file-validator.ts`)
- **Security checks** for suspicious filenames and malicious content
- **File type and size validation** on server-side
- **Integrated into transcription endpoint**

### ⚠️ Error Message Sanitization
- **Sanitized error responses** in all API routes
- **Production-safe error messages** that don't leak implementation details
- **Structured error codes** for client-side handling

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Before using the application, you MUST:**

1. **Generate new API keys** for all services:
   - OpenAI API Key
   - Anthropic API Key  
   - Google AI API Key
   - Clerk Secret Keys
   - Any other exposed credentials

2. **Update environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill in your new API keys
   ```

3. **Install missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install zod
   ```

4. **Test the protected endpoints** to ensure authentication is working

## 🔧 WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### File Structure Created:
```
src/lib/
├── auth/
│   └── api-auth.ts           # Authentication middleware
├── rate-limit/
│   └── rate-limiter.ts       # Rate limiting system
├── security/
│   └── headers.ts            # Security headers
└── validation/
    └── file-validator.ts     # File validation utilities
```

### API Route Updates:
- All routes now require authentication
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting applied
- Comprehensive error handling
- File validation for uploads

### Security Headers:
- Content Security Policy configured
- XSS protection enabled
- Clickjacking prevention
- HTTPS enforcement
- Referrer policy set

## 📋 TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Verify authentication is required for all API calls
- [ ] Test rate limiting by making multiple requests
- [ ] Confirm file uploads validate size and type
- [ ] Check security headers in browser dev tools
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid inputs

## 🎯 NEXT RECOMMENDED STEPS

1. **Set up monitoring** for rate limit violations
2. **Implement logging** for security events  
3. **Add CAPTCHA** for repeated failed attempts
4. **Set up automated security scanning**
5. **Regular security audits** (monthly)

## 🔒 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

Before deploying to production:
1. Set all environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
3. Configure proper DNS and security policies
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Test all security measures in staging environment
