# Security Audit Report - Startup Pitches Application

**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Application:** Pista - AI-Powered Startup Pitch Evaluator  
**Framework:** Next.js 15 with TypeScript  

## Executive Summary

This security audit identifies several **CRITICAL** vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The application has exposed API keys in the repository and lacks proper authentication validation in API routes, creating significant security risks.

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Immediate Action Required)

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: API Keys Exposed in Repository
- **File:** `.env.local` (committed to git)
- **Risk:** High - All API keys are publicly visible
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of external services
- **Exposed Keys:**
  - OpenAI API Key: `sk-proj-hUQ3gYzRf...` (full key visible)
  - Anthropic API Key: `sk-ant-api03-Zyjyz1mR...` (full key visible)
  - Google AI API Key: `AIzaSyCfnxCxWK1Rk6c-EzRM...` (full key visible)
  - Clerk Secret Key: `sk_test_KcT8bpGC...` (full key visible)
  - Database credentials and OAuth secrets

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Revoke ALL exposed API keys immediately
2. Remove `.env.local` from git history
3. Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`
4. Generate new API keys and store in environment variables

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Missing API Route Authentication
- **Files:** All routes in `src/app/api/`
- **Risk:** High - API endpoints accessible without authentication
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to AI evaluation services
- **Affected Routes:**
  - `/api/transcribe` - Audio processing without auth validation
  - `/api/evaluate` - AI evaluation without user verification
  - `/api/generate-questions` - Question generation without auth
  - `/api/evaluate-answers` - Answer processing without auth

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Implement Clerk authentication middleware for all API routes
2. Add user session validation before processing requests
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### File Upload Security
- **Missing:** File type validation on server side
- **Risk:** Medium - Potential malicious file uploads
- **Current State:** Client-side validation only in dropzone
- **Recommendation:** Add server-side MIME type validation and file scanning

### Input Validation
- **Missing:** Request body validation in API routes
- **Risk:** Medium - Potential injection attacks
- **Current State:** Basic type checking only
- **Recommendation:** Implement Zod schemas for all API inputs

### Error Information Disclosure
- **Issue:** Detailed error messages in API responses
- **Risk:** Medium - Information leakage
- **Example:** OpenAI error details exposed to client
- **Recommendation:** Sanitize error messages for production

## MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### Environment Variable Handling
- **Issue:** Multiple API providers configured but not properly secured
- **Current State:** Keys stored in single env file
- **Recommendation:** Use proper secrets management service

### Database Access Pattern
- **Issue:** No additional access controls beyond Convex built-ins
- **Current State:** Relies entirely on Convex security
- **Recommendation:** Implement additional authorization checks

### Client-Side Security
- **Missing:** Content Security Policy headers
- **Missing:** Proper session management configuration
- **Recommendation:** Implement security headers and CSP

## POSITIVE SECURITY PRACTICES

### Authentication Implementation
- âœ… Uses Clerk for user authentication
- âœ… Proper middleware configuration for protected routes
- âœ… Organization-based access control in Convex queries

### Database Security
- âœ… User identity validation in Convex mutations
- âœ… Organization-scoped data access
- âœ… Proper indexing for secure queries

### File Handling
- âœ… File size limits implemented (5MB text, 25MB audio)
- âœ… Client-side file type restrictions
- âœ… Progress tracking for uploads

## SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (0-3 days)
1. **Remove and regenerate all API keys**
2. **Implement API route authentication**
3. **Add server-side input validation**
4. **Remove .env.local from git history**

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Implement rate limiting**
2. **Add Content Security Policy**
3. **Server-side file validation**
4. **Error message sanitization**

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **Security headers implementation**
2. **Secrets management service**
3. **Security testing automation**
4. **Audit logging implementation**

### Long Term (3+ months)
1. **Regular security audits**
2. **Penetration testing**
3. **Security monitoring**
4. **Incident response procedures**

## RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX

| Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Exposed API Keys | Very High | Critical | **CRITICAL** |
| Unauthenticated APIs | High | High | **CRITICAL** |
| File Upload Issues | Medium | Medium | **HIGH** |
| Input Validation | Medium | Medium | **HIGH** |
| Error Disclosure | Low | Medium | **MEDIUM** |

## COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

- **GDPR:** User data handling appears compliant with proper deletion capabilities
- **PCI DSS:** Not applicable - no payment processing
- **SOC 2:** Would require additional security controls

## CONCLUSION

The application has a solid architectural foundation with Clerk authentication and Convex security, but **CRITICAL vulnerabilities exist that require immediate remediation**. The exposed API keys represent the highest priority security risk and must be addressed immediately to prevent service abuse and financial impact.

Priority should be given to:
1. Key rotation and repository cleanup
2. API authentication implementation  
3. Input validation and rate limiting

Once these critical issues are resolved, the application will have a much stronger security posture suitable for production use.
