I am incredibly grateful to my supervisor, Professor Xiaofeng Wang, for her expertise in entrepreneurship and technology, which greatly shaped both the technical development of Pista and the design of the research methodology. I am thankful for her facilitation of the comparative analysis with Winds2Ventures and for providing access to the startup pitch datasets, which were crucial for the statistical validation of this thesis. Additionally, I wish to acknowledge my thesis co-supervisor, Triando, for his steady support and thoughtful guidance, which were instrumental in navigating the project's challenges and motivated me to explore new research methods.

I am thankful to the Winds2Ventures team for providing access to their evaluation platform, which was instrumental in conducting the comparative research that significantly contributed to the depth and validity of the analysis.

In addition to my academic mentors, I owe heartfelt thanks to my family, whose consistent support and encouragement provided the foundation that carried me through the most challenging stages of this academic journey. I want to also acknowledge my girlfriend, who inspires me every day to be a better version of myself through her kindness, patience, and belief in me, which consistently gave me motivation and perspective during this journey.
