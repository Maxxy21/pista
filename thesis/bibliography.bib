The aim of this study is to facilitate more accurate decision-making with such AI-based DSS, as well as build trust through the need for visibility and explainability by increasing user acceptance. This study primarily examines the nature of AI-based DSS adoption and the challenges of maintaining system transparency and improving accuracy. The results provide practical guidance for professionals and decision-makers to develop AI-driven decision support systems that are not only effective but also trusted by users. The results are also important to gain insight into how artificial intelligence fits into and combines with decision-making, which can be derived from research when thinking about embedding systems in ethical standards.},

    abstract = {Entrepreneurs and investors often deem substantive content to be particularly important as they evaluate the potential value of business propositions. Yet across 12 studies and 1,855 participants using live entrepreneurial pitch competitions, silent videos—but not sound recordings, video-with-sound recordings, or pitch transcriptions—best allowed both experts and novices to identify the original investors’ selections of winning entrepreneurial pitches. These results suggest that people’s judgment may be highly influenced by visual information. Further, people do not seem to fully recognize how much visual information factors into their decisions, such that they neglect the more substantive metrics that they explicitly cite and value as core to their decisions. The findings highlight the power of dynamic visual cues—including gestures, facial expressions, and body language—and demonstrate that visible passion can dominate the content of business propositions in entrepreneurial pitch competitions.}

    abstract = {Introduction: Mental Workload (MWL) is a concept that has garnered increasing interest in professional settings but remains challenging to define consensually. The literature reports a plurality of operational definitions and assessment methods, with no established unified framework. This review aims to identify objective and validated measurement methods for evaluating MWL in real-world work contexts. Particular attention is given to neurophysiological methods, recognized for their efficiency and robustness, enabling real-time assessment without disrupting operator activity. Method: To conduct this analysis, a systematic search was performed in three databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and IEEEXplore), covering studies published from their inception until March 30, 2023. Selection criteria included research focusing on MWL and its derivatives, as well as neurophysiological measures applied in real-world conditions. An initial screening based on titles and abstracts was followed by an in-depth review, assisted by the bibliometric software Rayyan. Results: The explored concepts, applied methods, and study results were compiled into a synthesis table. Ultimately, 35 studies were included, highlighting the diversity of measurement tools used in field settings, often combined with subjective assessments. Discussion: Furthermore, key physiological indicators such as ECG, eye data, EEG and the relationship between MWL metrics and those uses to measure stress are emphasized and discussed. A better understanding of these interrelations could refine the assessment of their respective impacts and help anticipate their consequences on workers' mental health and safety.}

    abstract = {Software startups are responsible for fast product delivery to the market. To aid this process, a retrospective inside a startup team can be very fruitful for software development. The traditional way of conducting agile retrospectives involves discussion based on what went well, what did not go well, and how to improve the software development cycle helps to save resources, get directed toward the startup vision, and overcome several challenges. To attain insights about the agile retrospective approach in startups, we studied the following question: How are software startups performing agile retrospectives? Hence, we conducted seven multiple case studies with 19 semi-structured interviews that lasted 30--65 min. The results outline that all software startups prefer a reflection through agile retrospectives but not in the traditional manner. Due to the startup's casual and less restricted working environment, teams prefer informal agile retrospectives, which involve no confined boundaries of time, venue, and participants.},

    abstract = {We use a unique data set covering brokerage accounts for a large cross-section of investors over a sample from January 2003 to March 2012, which includes the 2008 financial crisis, to assess the potential benefits of robo-investing. We explore robo-investing strategies commonly used in the industry, including some involving advanced machine learning methods. We shadow each of our investors with a robo-advisor to shed light on possible benefits the emerging robo-advising industry may provide to certain segments of the population, such as low income and/or low education investors.}
