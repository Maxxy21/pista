\section{Diagram Sources}
The figures in Chapter~\ref{ch:problem-solution} were generated from Mermaid sources stored under \texttt{thesis/flows/}. The authentication flow is in \texttt{auth.mmd}, the submission flow in \texttt{submit.mmd}, the evaluation pipeline in \texttt{eval.mmd}, and the combined reference in \texttt{pista-flows.mmd}.
