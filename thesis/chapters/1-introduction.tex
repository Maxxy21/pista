Getting feedback on startup ideas is crucial for success. Startup founders need to pitch their ideas to investors and get useful feedback to improve their businesses. Research shows that investment decisions depend heavily on the quality of pitch presentations, which play a major role in securing financial support\cite{masterpresentat}. Many business functions have been changed substantially through technology improvements. However, pitch evaluation has not evolved much and still relies on in-person presentations and individual expert judgment.

This thesis investigates how AI can help solve this problem. Large language models like GPT-4 have become very useful for analyzing text and making structured evaluations across different areas \cite{Ozince2024}. These models work at levels comparable to humans in complex analysis tasks. This suggests clear potential to improve pitch evaluation processes through AI approaches \cite{gpt}.

However, pitch evaluation in the startup community faces several problems. Many evaluation processes use inconsistent standards. Quality feedback is hard to access, and evaluations take too long \cite{StartupEvaluati, Kalvapalle2024}. Current methods require significant time for each pitch and often give very different results among evaluators. These issues especially affect entrepreneurs from emerging markets and other underrepresented groups, who have limited access to expert feedback networks \cite{BreakingBarrier}.

To address these challenges, Pista, an AI-based pitch evaluation system\footnote{Project Website, \url{https://pista-app.vercel.app}}, is presented in this thesis and compared with Winds2Ventures (W2V) through a supervisor-facilitated comparison. The differences in their approaches are examined and their performance is evaluated. The system processes pitches in multiple formats including text, files, and audio recordings. Feedback is provided across four dimensions: problem-solution fit, business model viability, team execution capability, and pitch quality. The AI system focuses on analyzing text content and provides fast, consistent evaluation that can help entrepreneurs get feedback more easily. The comparison shows how different AI evaluation methods perform and where each approach works best \cite{TheFutureofAIEv}.
