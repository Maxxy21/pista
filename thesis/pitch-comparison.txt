Coontent

1.1

Transcript of the pitch

We hope this was sufficient for a brief introduction into our projects, but now
let’s open the barrel and jump right into the details. So we envision Coontent
as a dedicated member of your marketing team. Kuntend deals with all the boring tasks such as writing copy, publishing campaigns on the various platforms
and analyzing their performances. You can think of him as a marketing expert
who collaborates directly with your marketing team by doing all the dirty work
for you. The benefits you gain from Kuntend are completely game-changing.
Kuntend revolutionizes your marketing process by allowing you to save a significant time and money while also delivering high-quality results. What once took
hours of human efforts can now be accomplished within just 10 minutes. So
you can focus on the important parts such as coming up with ideas or marketing strategies. Kuntend is a business-to-business software-as-a-service platform
specifically designed for marketing departments and agencies. We offer a subscription model with various tiers and plans tailored to your needs. Our local
market research and customer interviews reveal a huge demand for marketing
support i Bolzano. With over 50 marketing agencies only in Bolzano, there is a
great demand for online marketing assistance here in this region. And Kuntend
fits this demand perfectly by supporting marketing agencies and departments
reaching their global audience. Let’s talk about how it works. Behind the
scenes, Kuntend uses a huge collection of prompt snippets that are dynamically
assembled to craft a custom prompt tailored to your specific campaign. You
simply select your campaign goal, define the type of text you want, and in the
end choose your publishing platform. And with this, Kuntend can create highquality copy following a fully guided process where everything is delivered to
you within a delightful user interface. So there’s no way to screw it up. Okay,
so in the beginning, we had a look at some possible competitors on the market. And we have seen that even though some of these tools allow the creation
of content via generative AI, they usually simply copied the chat window of
chat GPT. This meant that you had to write the prompt yourself. Because of
this, generally, GPT works with garbage in and garbage out, meaning that if a
prompt is bad, also the output will be bad. Kuntend solves this issue by doing
the prompting for you in the background, so you don’t have to worry about
it. Also, we’ve seen that most of these tools do the planning and management
aspect more than they do anything else. So because of this, we created an allround solution that allows you the planning, but also the, let’s say, the writing,
the publishing, and the analyzing of campaigns all in one platform. Also, our
plans are that in the last few months, we have seen that by creating an initial
proof of concept and turning it into reality, we have also had some interviews

4

with local industry experts, and they have shown us some ways to how we can
improve and refine our product. Because of this, we want to launch our product
in early 2025, and then expand beyond South Tyrell into more and larger, into
larger markets. Our team is composed by Elias Binder and Daniel Pinochart.
We are both AI enthusiasts and software engineering students, and we are also
backed by an industry expert called Andreas Inammer, who is a copywriter and
gives us some insight into the market. So now it’s time for you to skyrocket your
online marketing with Kuntend. Just join our waiting list now on kuntend.io
and follow us on our journey on how we create this software. Thank you very
much.

Transcript of the pitch

Learniness hurts the heart, and not just metaphorically. According to a study
published in Repubblica, such an isolation and lack of close friendships increase
the risk of heart disease and stroke by around 30%. Our solution, Cupica.
Cupica is an application that helps people to build real connections. Whether
you’re searching for a hiking partner, a soccer team, or simply someone to share
your interest with, Cupica makes it easy. The app connects people through
shared interests, creating real friendships and strong communities. A study
published in 2024 showed that 52Italians feel an increase in social distancing,
and almost 50% of them is aged between 25 and 34. With our interviews,
we discovered that the ones who struggle the most in finding new friends are
workers, especially those who move to a new city. And for those who come from
abroad, another barrier is the language. So with 2.4% of Italians and 3.3% of
Europeans that relocate yearly for working purposes and so have to rebuild their
circle of friends, the market potential for Cupica is huge. This data represents
a concrete opportunity for Cupica. Ok, so what about our users? We aim to
build a strong sense of community and inclusion, providing a general-purpose
tool for organizing and finding activities. And we also take care about people
from different cultures and languages. Taking a look at our competition, we can
find friends finding applications and activity-specific applications, but none of
them cares about integrating different languages, support for inclusivity, and on
top of that, you have to have one single application for each different activity
you would like to pursue. So what about our plan? We are in the ending
phase of the validation. In the next three months, we plan to release an MVP,
gathering feedback and creating initial traction. On the six-month mark, we
plan to release a beta version with pivotal features for Cupica, being the group
discovery and the event creation feature. About revenue, we plan to release
an initial free plan application, where unlimited event participation is offered,
and the creation and management of one single event. To create more events
or use the built-in chat, there is a premium plan, in order to let’s say avoid
associations to promote their business through our free product. This is our
team, this is Alice, the creative part of the team, I’m Dylan, more oriented on
the technical aspect, and we bring to Cupica our experience. We both work
in an international environment, we both had to relocate for study and work,
and on top of that, we practice team sports, so we need people to do it with.
So what are you waiting for? Please invest in Cupica, share with friends and
family, and download the application. Thank you.

Serenity

3.1

Transcript of the pitch

Good morning everyone. Stress is a daily struggle mostly for us students and
young professionals because we have to juggle our very busy time schedule in the
week and month. And existing solutions often feel time-consuming, impersonal
or intimidating, coming from the growing social anxiety in this generation. In
the EU in 2021 almost one in five deaths among those aged 15 to 29 was registered as intentional self-harm, as shown in the Eurostat study. And that’s where
our solution comes in, Serenity, a dynamic mental well-being platform that is
targeted specifically for young adults. But Serenity isn’t just an application, in
fact it is more of a personal companion that gives the user the possibility to take
charge of their own mental health by providing the tools that fit seamlessly into
their lives. So Serenity acts as a supplementary tool to traditional counselling
and it offers anonymous 24-7 support for mental health, relaxation, stress reducing and it overall just promotes well-being. So leveraging the AI-driven insights,
Serenity provides three main features. We have a personalized mood tracking
7

and analytics, then also personalized wellness resources that includes for example mindfulness exercises, self-care routines and stress relief techniques, and then
we also have a responsive AI-powered chatbot that is obviously available 24-7
to talk to the user. So we actually also got to analyze the potential competitors
that we have on our market and we saw that compared to our application they
focus more on lengthy sessions and general mindfulness, so what they do is they
take the traditional approach and digitalize it somehow. We wanted to take a
completely new approach by making Serenity quick and discreet. So taking a
look at the market share we like to address, a study showed us that in 2023 the
market for mental wellness applications was of 139.9 billion dollars and it is forecasted to grow to 216.8 billion dollars in 2030. So how do we plan our revenue?
As also other teams showed we structure it in two plans, a free plan which has
limited features like chatting time or also default reminders and a premium plan
which will cost 4.99 euro and which gives the user in-depth analysis, unlimited
chatting time and also custom reminders for activities. What is our roadmap?
First we would like to create an MVP with basic tools and mood tracking. In
the second phase we would like to introduce the advanced analytics part which
helps the user identifying further problems and in phase three we would like
to partner with wellness organizations to make our audience larger and reach
more customers. Yeah this is us Marco and me Lisa, the team behind Serenity.
We’re both very passionate about creating a world where wellness is accessible,
relatable and also empowering for young adults. Thank you for letting us share
our vision with you today and we would love to answer any questions that you
might have.

Sundove

4.1

Transcript of the pitch

and today we are going to present Sundar. We believe that our romantic relationship is the most important aspect of our life, and being in a relationship, a
great relationship, fills our life with happiness. We found that problems arise in
couples when they have different expectations, and they are not communicated
properly. According to a study of 30,000 people, the most common issue for 80%
of them is communication problems. We spoke to couples and learned that communication is not easy, especially communicating our thoughts and feelings. We
are not taught from young how to do this. Couple therapy is an existing solution, but nearly 60% of couples think that their problems are not serious enough
for therapy. That’s why we want to help couples improve their relationship in a
more accessible way by developing intentional communication. Intentional communication is expressing thoughts, feelings and needs purposefully, thoughtfully
and with clarity. And we believe that intentional communication can be trained
by having deep conversation. That is why we are creating Sundarv, a mobile application that offers curated courses on important topics that inspire couples to
discover more about each other and uncover questions that they never thought
about. We have here a snippet of a course covering the topic Navigating Conflict
as a Couple. This includes informative materials and exercises with thoughtprovoking questions that the couple themselves can work on together. Just like
how a fitness app can help us improve our physical health but not do the work
for us, Sundarv aims to support a couple’s relationship by guiding them through
deep conversations. This will be especially useful for couples who are looking
forward and preparing their next stage in life, be it marriage, moving in or
starting a new family together. Couples do not need to have a serious problem
in their relationship to be able to benefit from this. To test our approach, we
have built a simple, minimum viable experience using the same topic. In this
MVE, couples will go through the material, review their past, present and future ways to handle conflict and talk about it together. Through this MVE, we
want to understand if this is valuable to other couples. We publish it on Notion

9

and are working to gather feedback on it from relevant communities. We are
still at the very early stages, but we are planning to develop our solution with
an in-app purchase model, where couples can access different types of courses,
where there are foundational ones that are free of charge and advanced ones for
which the price will vary. The most common competitors are other apps for
couples and more traditional ways such as books or couple therapy. We found
that apps tend to remain very much surface level, while books lack the engagement of more modern media. And couple therapy, unfortunately, is not always
accessible in terms of cost and access to qualified professionals. With Sandov,
we aim to hit a sweet spot of depth, accessibility and engagement. The team
working on Sandov is composed of Cristal and Matteo, myself. While we have
expertise in software development, we are passionate about our love and couple
relationships. We are learning a lot and we want to share these useful insights
through Sandov. Finally, we are looking for a collaboration with experts in the
field of relationship psychology. Thanks for your time and attention, and if you
have any questions or feedback, we are happy to hear from you.

Fitly

5.1

Transcript of the pitch

Have you ever thought about how can I easily choose an outfit quickly without
wearing it on and to have a look how it will look like on me? We have a solution
for you. Introducing Fitly, your personal stylist right in your pocket ready to
show you the perfect outfit for you based on your personal suggestions. The
only thing you need to do is you need to upload clothes from your wardrobe
or select them from our database and our assistant can generate can generate
all the outfits for you. For the validation part, initially we thought about two
target groups, fashion-oriented people and casual dressers. But after taking the
interview, we realized that casual dressers are not interested in spending time on
choosing outfits. Our app is not necessary for them. Our market and first target
region we will focus on is going to be Europe, especially because we understand
the Europe regulations and the laws. The projected AI fashion tech growth
in the years till 2030 is going to be about 35we looked at, approximately 118
million fashion-oriented individuals will be where we’re considering people we’re
considering themselves fashion-oriented individuals in 2023. Yes, our customer
analysis, so we expect the majority of our customers to be women between the
ages of 16 till 44. Those we expect to use our application the most and the
occasion-based planning time depends on the occasion that they are preparing
themselves for. And for our revenue plan, for the free tier we would offer limited
outfit suggestions and confined wardrobe style and some basic personalized options. Whereas by using the premium version, a customer could use unlimited
outfit suggestions, more advanced personalization and deeper customization together with for a broader customer support and early access to new features.
Currently our project revolves around the problem validation that was being
spoken by my previous colleague and also problem solution fit that we were
doing in our team Lean Canvas. In the next six months we expect to launch
the minimum viable product with essential features, gather user feedback and
build initial traction to be used for the next iterations of our product. And
the next year we hopefully would scale the product, improve the features and
expand the user base. And our teams consist of me, Justyna, my colleagues
Katarina and Andrey. And while we don’t have much experience in fashion
industry, we do believe that that doesn’t stop us from creating a useful product
in this area. We kindly invite you in joining and revolutionizing the way people
choose their outfits and partnering with us and being a part of a personalized
and sustainable fashion future.

Math4Me

6.1

Transcript of the pitch

I start the presentation. My name is Paolo Peroni. I’m a designer. Math4Me
is the solution to give parents who are concerned about their children’s math
difficulties the real chance to put their children in a position to do well. Imagine
you are 12 years old. You struggle with math. Your friends do well. Their
parents are proud. But you don’t. And your parents look worried for your
future. According to UNESCO, 60% of our students don’t reach the minimum
acceptable level in math. In the European community and in Italy, 35% of
students in high school don’t perform well. From 20 to 30% of families cannot
afford a private tutor. And this is a problem. Those kids lose self-esteem. They
12

are excluded by their friends. And we noticed this during our interviews. They
are afraid of limited future opportunities. Math4Me is a new learning system
based by interactive lessons. It keeps tracking of the progress of the student. It
uses gimmified elements. And it uses cooperative learning with schoolmates. It
works because it adapts to each child’s learning pace. It’s not just about solving
problems. It’s about rebuilding their confidence. We made some interviews to
collect data from a math teacher, a student and his father. We received positive
and interesting feedback from them, which encouraged our research. In Italy,
the economic income deriving from e-learning is growing rapidly. And from
the forecast, it would seem that it will continue to do so for the coming years.
Furthermore, in Italy, this system could be a market necessity and could involve
up to half of the students in our target. The target customer is the parent who
purchases our product and installs it on his or her son or daughter’s devices.
It is a little early to set a precise price at this stage, but certainly a paper-use
model will be used. Thank you for the attention. I’m Math4Me.

CampoRapido

7.1

Transcript of the pitch

Welcome everyone, we are Elevate Team and we’re going to present Campo
Rapido, which is our new digital solution for revolutionizing sports facility bookings. First of all, we’re going to present the problem and as we can see, this
problem of bookings, sports facilities, it’s both a problem from the client side,
so the people that want to book for playing and the people that manage the
facilities. In our case, we’re going to focus for the people that are managing the
facilities and as we can see on the top, we have this little figure that represents
the person that is in charge.
So right now we have disconnected calendars, plank interfaces and lack of
insights, that’s main problems, mainly because all the bookings is done manually
and on paper, so these problems are a consequential part of it. So what we
propose? We propose the solution, which is a digital platform, which is called
Campo Rapido and it’s a digital booking platform, so basically the person that
is in charge of the fields is able to manage all the bookings on his phone or
laptop and is going to have an advanced algorithm that basically displays some
dashboard with some insights, basically like money earned or like changing the
timetable if they have to maintain the field and so on, and this will produce a
seamless experience for the manager.
So right now these are all words, basically it’s a method if you feel the experience yourself. Regional booking methods are inefficient, often involving phone
calls, emails and in-person visits. The sports field booking system is problematic
due to the owner’s frequent availability and reliance on a paper-based system.
We need to explore digital alternatives for smoother operations. Facilities lose
revenue due to underutilized resources and lost booking. Unreliable booking processes leading to confusion and frustration of the facility owners. They deserve a
streamlined transparent process. Campo Rapido is here, revolutionizing sports
field bookings, digital booking platform, just a seamless experience, connecting
sports facilities with athletes, real-time availability and secure payments.

Rideshare

8.1

Transcript

Okay, so let’s start. Good morning, we are the Blue.team and today we are
going to present our product, Rideshare, and we would like to start with a short
video. Okay, so let’s start. Okay, so let’s start. So, as we’ve seen from the
video, moving inside the city can be a struggle for many different reasons, and
even if you own a car and you don’t have this problem, then there are other
issues that occur, such as spending a lot of time stuck in traffic or searching
for a parking spot, and there are expenses for fuel and car maintenance. Of
course, these problems occur mainly in areas where the public transportation
and or the bike infrastructures are lacking or in existence, because if you live in
Bolsan you don’t have this problem, and in those areas then also the problem of
traffic and of searching for parking is increased. Yeah, so we decided we wanted
to propose a ridesharing solution, and this is meant mainly for short distances
and possibly repeated commutes, and you have two sides, so on the rider’s side
you would be able to book a ride from a list of verified users, whereas from
the driver’s side you would be able to publish your ride and therefore monetize
commutes that you would perform anyway, and the magic is that it’s of course
all in one place, so you have one platform to do finding, publishing, verifying,
in-app payment, you don’t have to use many platforms for that, and of course
the way we want to monetize this is by using a transaction-based model, so
we would collect a 10% fee off of the transactions from the rider’s side, and of
course we want to monetize our insights and our data to help local businesses.
15

So our main competitors are Efficient Town Management, because of course
if you have a bus that works very well, and if you can ride around the city
with your bike then you don’t need our service. There are other companies, for
example BlaBlaCar, that offer car-sharing, carpooling services, but those are
aimed for long-distance commutes. So to validate our idea we created, as for
an MVP, two spotted-like Instagram pages, and we’ve learned that doing social
media is very time-consuming and requires a lot of effort. However, there are
other spotted-like accounts that are mainly focused on university environments,
and in those accounts there are a lot of requests on a weekly basis asking for
commutes, or searching for rides, or offering rides. So also those validate our
assumption for these needs. So I’m Fabio. And I’m Gianluca with the Blue Dog
team. We thank you for your attention, and of course we invite you to engage
with us on our platforms. Thank you.

Corptech

Transcript

Gentlemen, I see we’re a little bit tired. So yeah, Qualtech, that’s Qualtech. We
are a software company that aims to deliver the most cutting edge industrial
monitoring solutions for companies. Our first use case that we’re presenting
today is specifically focused on methane leak detection. Companies around the
world are losing billions of dollars due to methane leaks. But aside from financial losses, it also has a severe impact on our environments and our ecology. So
to this day, about 30% of global warming is attributed to methane emissions.
What is our solution? Our solution is an AI and software bundle that integrates
seamlessly with the latest optical gas imaging technology, which allows the companies to easily quantify the leak, detect it earlier, and provide 24-7 monitoring.
The market size for this solution is immense and it continues to grow. Worldwide, the market for industrial monitoring is estimated at around 18 billion US
dollars, but it continues to grow at a steady rate of around 11, 12%. For the
first five years, we want to focus specifically on methane gas and we expect to
make off of that around, well, over a million euro by year five in revenue. So
we’ve already introduced the product, the Duriq. Here’s a tablet where you
can get familiar with the interface. Look around, play around with it. And the
best part is we already have traction. We have a global distribution partner,
Pyram Gamitalia, who are willing to buy our licensing for 600 euro per license
per camera. And we’ve already, and we’ve spoken with one of the largest gas
companies in Germany, and they said that they are piloting a similar solution.
So there’s a clear demand, there’s a clear need for what we’re trying to solve.
We’re a team of five, but we are looking for AI and machine learning experts.
There is massive competition in the market. There are three main companies
who control most of the market at the moment, but we estimate that because
we are optimizing due to our accuracy and due to process optimization, we can
save our customers anywhere from 180,000 euro to over a million euro annually.
Some key metrics. We believe that as soon as we start retailing 282 licenses
per annum, we’re going to start operating at a break-even level. We expect to
generate a total revenue of over 1 million annually by year 10. And by year
six, when we enter the wider industrial monitoring market, we would have a
retail earnings of 60,000. Our starting price, we’re going to start off with a flat
fee of 600 euro per camera per license. But in year six, we plan to shift to a
SaaS model when we start operating in a wider market. We need 100,000, we
need 190,000 euro. Most of it will go to research and development and labor
expenses, because that’s based on the comparables analysis that we did during
our research. And for the first five years, we don’t need to retain Salesforce
because, well, we have a partner who can go out and do it.

Transcript

Great, so I will take over now to tell you a little bit more about AssistMe. My
name is Tytti, I’m the CEO of AssistMe and I am very excited to share you
about our product. You can go to the next slide. And the next one from here.
So AssistMe is a new kind of enterprise productivity app and our mission is to
reduce the mental load to increase productivity by helping people stay on their
tasks and making it easier for them to manage their professional and private
life. So we’re more geared towards these busy professionals that are having a
hard time managing all of their calendars, all of their assignments and this is
what we are here to do. So for the problems, what we have seen validated by our
18

survey data is that a lot of people still struggle with managing their meetings,
prioritizing their tasks, staying on top of their goals and planning their day-today life and we are here to provide a solution for that. So what our product
is going to do is to provide you with smarter ways to schedule your meetings
and create follow-ups, also providing automated transcripts for you to take the
mental load off of creating meeting notes and for you to share and customize
your calendars and adjust your availability. We’re helping people to also to
achieve their goals by this AI chat assistant that will make it take the mental
load off your shoulders and moving it into a smarter way of working. We see
that there is a huge demand for this service still since a lot of meetings are still
happening in person in addition to the ones online. For instance, in the US, as
you can see, there’s almost three meetings per day for a lot of people and many
people are still using regular paper calendars and we want to provide them with
a digital first opportunity to manage their time. Looking at the market size,
we can see that the productivity market is currently valued at 5.7 billion in
2023 and it’s expected to have a steady growth rate up to 2030. There is still a
lot of growth happening and this is driven by the digitalization of professional
and private life. Based on our business model, we offer two different kinds of
subscriptions. The other one would be a free version with certain limitations
to the features available and our main focus will be on the enterprise version,
which is offering 20 users for 350 euros per month and this will also have some
additional features for our enterprise customers. Of course, the freemium model
allows you to share your calendar with your loved ones, which makes it easier
for you to manage your time with your family and keep them up to date with
your life. What we’re seeing based on our research on our competitors is that
especially our enterprise model will offer a very wide range of features that are
not available in the free version.

So firstly, we wanted to, coming into university, being a first year, facing the
first problem almost immediately was that disorganization, so currently if you
look at a university student’s journey when you wake up in the morning and
you have to figure out what exactly am I meant to do today, you have to go
to basically 10 different places, five of which work on your phone, three only
work on your laptop, you’re going to Moodle, you’re going to something else.
As a basic MVP, we’re trying to organize all of that into one place so that
you basically have one interface where you know what exactly I have to do on
today, basically. So currently the existing solutions out there are you have like
your Google Calendar, your notes, if you look at some of those, that’s what
my Moodle looked like on a day when I had five classes, sort of. It says I have
nothing to do. If you switch here, this is where the problem comes in, is that
there are things that I can add my calendar to, but I have to go through this,
which is clunky and archaic and something that you really need to sit down
and have a next level degree of consciousness, conscientiousness to be able to
do consistently. So instead, we’re shifting this input format into something that
all of us can do, which is language. So essentially you kind of just tell your app
the way you would describe it to a chat GPT. Okay, I’ve got this, this and this,
something you remember on the bus, you just type it in. I’ve got a meeting at
five o’clock and boom, you have it in your calendar. So we describe it as like
talking to a friend who listens, remembers, and ultimately helps you get things
done. This is more of the idealized product, whereas the basic is really, the
MVP is really just an input in through language and an output out through
a scheduling app. But eventually down the line, we want to add gamification
features. We want to integrate with university backends so we can get their
data and you can kind of import data from Moodle that’s further down the line.
We want to start in the Finnish market. And given that we are in a

Shieldskin. My name is Valentin and I’m happy to start now for our presentation. First of all we would look at our product again so you get a closer shot.
One thing we mentioned in the video that’s very very important is that we’ve
got protectors on the shoulders, in the back and as well on the elbows and you
can remove them and wear the jacket in a day-to-day casual environment as
well. We’ve got more designs. The one on the left is one very special exclusive
design and you get an impression of our product. Our social mission we mentioned as well. I want to stress that because it’s really important to us. We
21

use leather waste to produce new gloves and gift them to people for free here in
Finland. Looking at our business. First of all riding a motorcycle is extremely
dangerous so people need protection and they want it as well usually. However
motorcycle jackets often are very very bulky and are not convenient. You can’t
wear them in normal environments usually and they tend to be very expensive
and this is the issue we are solving. Who are our customers? Go back please.
Our customers are motorcyclists aging 18 to 35 and they want protection and
as well convenience to wear them in normal day-to-day life and they have a
sense for style. Our plans. We are starting here in Finland. We’re gonna set
up the business make it profitable and after presumably one year we’ll expand
to Sweden building infrastructure for expansion and in the third year we’ll go
to Europe to the bigger markets. Looking at our financials for the first two
years we’ll be starting in Finland and then by the end of the first year we hope
to get a market share of about 2.6% and with a revenue of 314,000 euros we
are looking to return to our investors 58.9% of the investment with a profit of
60,602 euros. Then expanding to Sweden by the second year we hope to have a
combined market share of 4.87% and with a revenue of 950,000 euros returning
for investors 330% and a profit of 282,000 euros. Now looking at our competitors we have Polo Motorrad and their prices ranges between 350 and 550 euros
while the jacket maker Diaz ranges between 280 and 350 euros and then what
stands us apart is affordability. Our product is going to be having a price of
229.4 euros including VAT and our quality is top-notch and then we have the
social welfare expert and sustainability attached to it and the team is made up
of me, the chief

So, hi everyone. So we are a team of sauna lovers, just like you and me. I’m
sharing joining me today is Yuga. So, imagine, finding and reserving a unique
sauna experience as easy as reserving a hotel room on booking.com. That’s
sauna you and me. It’s a one-stop digital hub for everything sauna, from traditional smoking sauna to floating adventure. But finding, like this one, floating
sauna, but finding a perfect sauna or just a sauna you want can be a hassle. Like
Daniel in the video, many face endless hours researching, and skater booking
system, confusing payment options. There’s no single platform to make everything easy, leaving many sauna lovers like you and me confused, overwhelming,
and underserved. The solution, sauna you and me is the solution. It’s a super
app or website, make stop booking and finding sauna easy and simple. You
can discover, compare, book, pay, all in one single place. It’s faster, it’s user
friendly, and it’s designed to give you unforgettable sauna experience. In Finland, there are more than 2 million saunas, with 70, 90% of Finns using sauna
weekly, 40% of them using sauna multiple times per week. And the global sauna
market is growing. Wellness tourism is a $900 billion industry. According to
our survey, more than 70% of our responders are eager to book their sauna experience digitally. So we start in Finland, and we are ready to scale worldwide.
Then our main revenue stream would be commission fee, as our competitors
or similar platforms are also doing. And we would also include listing fees as
like a premium package for having like more visibility. And then other revenue
stream would be advertisement shown in our site. And comparing us to our
competitors, they usually don’t have integrated bookings or doesn’t cover all
types of saunas in one place. They have like one type only or might be limited
to only capital region in Finland. And they have, all of them only have like
web page and they have like no mobile app. And some of them even lacking
English version, many of them have, but some of them are lacking still. And
presenting our team. So Shirin is our CEO and kind of ideator behind of this.
And Daniel is our CMO and I’m CFO. And Anja is our CTO. And here’s how

23

some projections, how we will grow. And we are expected that we will make
profit third year. So we’ll be realistic with that. That’s the main key takeaway
here. And what are we seeking? We are seeking funding for 55,000 seed funding
in exchange of 10% equity, which will help us scale the platform further. And
we are looking at partnerships like local sauna providers and tourism boards
to enhance our offerings. And we are also looking team members like customer
specialists and data analysts. And kind of, yeah, more people, people with more
knowledge basically. And that’s it. Thank you.

Transcript

So, everybody, welcome to MatchIT, revolutionary recruitment platform for IT
companies. What was the idea behind? We all face this situation when there is
limited HR resources, inaccurate job requirements, and in this way, hiring becoming a very risky process. You don’t understand everything what companies
want from you and companies, in turn, do not understand what to expect from
people. And this is a big problem. Solution? MatchIT. It is a platform for job
seekers to show their real skill level and confirm it. MatchIT provides skill-based
evaluation of candidates and MatchIT brings trust between candidates because
companies will be able to see their real skills and real experience. And in turn,
for companies, because the people will be able to see the trusted reviews for the
companies and their real offerings and not the lies you can find, for instance,
on other platforms. Market is very big and most importantly, it’s very scalable.
Only on the Finnish market, there is 137,000 employees in the ICT sector and
33,000 new hirings in 2023. It is an amazing scalability for EU market because
there is 9.8 million specialists in the ICT sector. Now let’s take a look what does
it mean to us? How can we bring money? How can we bring value? The value
is brought by the experience and understanding of the situation. We’ve been
asking people from different industries like HR, coders and also developers and
they showed that there is a need for the platform where everything is united.
All services under one ecosystem and problem extend well to selling consultants
and it will be very easy to compare skills directly. So there is an old way of
hiring. There is DooneyTory and Jobly where you can see the ads and that’s
mostly it. And there is a new way of hiring, the LeadCode and HackerRank
and others, where you can access skills of employees, but at the same time, you
can ensure there is no connection between them. And in this way, the combined
way is MatchIT, when there is both confirmed skills and information about the
work and links. So the process, for instance, for DooneyTory to hire one person
for the company costs 2,500 euros. We are offering a cost cap of 1,000 euros and
in three years, we’re aiming for a minimum market share of 1.5% in Finland,
around 500 persons per year. And in this case, after four years, our net present
value will exceed 300,000 euros. Amazing numbers. And the scalability after
these three years to the European market shows great results. And our fantastic
team of four people of Emil, Matvei, Heikki and Joel is happy to invite you to
invest into our project. We ask for 15,000 euros and we are ready to bargain,
offering 10% of the share in our company. But this is just the start. So you can
see what we want and how we’ll implement it. So the decision is yours. Thank
you.

So, everybody, welcome to MatchIT, revolutionary recruitment platform for IT
companies. What was the idea behind? We all face this situation when there is
limited HR resources, inaccurate job requirements, and in this way, hiring becoming a very risky process. You don’t understand everything what companies

people. And this is a big problem. Solution? MatchIT. It is a platform for job
seekers to show their real skill level and confirm it. MatchIT provides skill-based
evaluation of candidates and MatchIT brings trust between candidates because
companies will be able to see their real skills and real experience. And in turn,

PolyGlobe

Transcript

We are PolyGlobe and we are here to change the way people learn languages.
Imagine stepping into a virtual cafe in Paris or navigating a train station in
Tokyo all while practicing a local language. With PolyGlobe we bring immersive
gamified learning experiences to life, making language learning more effective,
engaging, and fun. So language learning today has three big problems. First,
learners often struggle to imply what they have learned in real life. Second,
speaking a new language can feel intimidating, creating a fear of making mistakes. And third, most methods today are hard and boring, leading many to
quit before they achieve fluency. So our solution is PolyGlobe, a VR-based app
that transforms language learning into an immersive adventure. We already
created a rough prototype and we are ready to bring this to the global market
with a lot of languages. Market size and opportunity. The language learning
market is booming, valued at $61.5 billion in 2023 and expected to double by
2031. Meanwhile, VR in education, worth $3.8 billion in 2023, is growing at
an impressive 18% annually. PolyGlobe stands at the intersection of these two
trends, offering an immersive gamified solution for students, travelers, with millions seeking better ways to learn languages. And the opportunity is vast and
growing. Okay, and on this slide you can see a quick overview of our team.
Then you can go on to the next slide. PolyGlobe operates in a competitive
space with huge players like Duolingo and many others. However, what sets
us apart is the immersive VR experience that places learners directly into realworld scenarios, encouraging them to speak the language. Then you can go on
to the next slide. While competitors like Duolingo gamify language learning,
PolyGlobe goes a step further by incorporating social features, allowing users
to practice in a virtual community. This creates a more engaging and practical
learning environment which traditional apps can’t offer. Yeah, and then here
31

you can see a matrix on where we are compared to our competitors. Then the
next slide. In our first year, we aim to reach 30,000 users, leveraging the growing
VR adoption rate of 120 million global users. With a planned ramp-up growth
model, our first-year revenue is estimated at 49,000. On the cost side, initial
platform and app development will require 300,000, followed by 50,000 monthly
updates and hosting expenses. Overall first-year costs total to 420,000. We are
confident that with user acquisition growth, we’ll achieve a strong foundation
for scaling revenue and impact. We are seeking 500,000 in funding for software
development, launching a marketing campaign, and to acquire users. Our key
milestones include launching a beta within six months, acquiring 30,000 users
in year one, and scaling our immersive scenarios. PolyGlobe is positioned at
the cutting edge of VR education.

Mediflow

Transcript

Today, Paul and I want to present Mediflow. So first, maybe some of you experience some of those pains when taking medicine. First, you are ill, you go
to your medicine cabinet and you see, okay, the medicine that I want to take
is expired. Next, when you found another medicine, you have to read through
long descriptions in order to get to know how you have to consume the medicine.
And finally, a few days later, you realize, okay, I forgot to take the pill in the
morning. And the solution is Mediflow, and you just got to know our application through the video. So let’s have a look at the market. So actually, there’s a
big market potential. On the left side, you can see the average pharmaceutical
spendings of countries in Central Europe. And you can see that Germany is in
the lead. And there’s also a quite big growth potential. There are also current
trends that are beneficial for our Mediflow idea. First, people are getting older.
And older people tend to have more illnesses. And also older people are becoming more familiar with the smartphones. Next, there’s also a health grant going
on in Central Europe. And people consume more supplements. So our revenue
streams will be affiliate links to online pharmacies. There will be premium features, as mentioned in the video. For example, you can book an appointment
with health professionals. And there will also be in-app advertisement. So let’s
have a look at our team. So our team consists of three motivated persons with
backgrounds in business and also in IT. However, we need a programmer and
also a UI designer to launch our startup. Let’s have a look at the competition.
So actually, there are already pill notification apps. There are online pharmacies where you can buy the medicine. And there are also apps where you can
book online appointments with health professionals. However, we are the all-inone solution. So our app combines all these features. And on addition to those
features, we also have expiration tracking. People can see the medicine information, the most important medicine information at a glance. They can buy the
medicine at the best price through affiliate links to several online pharmacies.
And there will also be AI features. For example, you can take a picture of your
prescription. And there will be automatically a treatment plan added to your
user account. Okay, so this is our financial strategy. These indicators show how
we are becoming profitable. While our cumulative cash flow starts negative due
to investment in marketing and development, we reached the breakeven point
between month 11 and month 12. Regarding the cash flow sufficiency index, we
can see that even at the lowest point around month 7, we still are able to cover
our operating costs of the next months. MediFlow is more than an investment
opportunity. It’s a way to transform the healthcare market. We are operating on a fast-growing market with a result of real traction. We are looking for
€250,000 that we will spend about 60% in marketing, 40% in development, and
10in results. With your support, we aim to multiply your investments by five
within five years. MediFlow is ready. We have the vision, we have the team,
and we have the market. All we need is you. Invest in MediFlow today and
33

let’s simplify care together. Thank you.

and we are bringing data-driven decision-making to forests, fields and farms
with the help of growth. To increase production from forests, crop use from
farms and efficiently managing land, gathering a single land level data is the
direction forestry and agriculture industry are going towards. However, there
is a large group of forest owners and farmers that are lacking information and
they do not have enough financial resources to actively start using these trending
technologies. And we are educating them, showing the actual value as well as
34

being part of these communities. Our service will offer a service without the
customer not needing any equipment themselves and our end product will be
easy to understand suggestions and reports based on their area and problematic
parts especially. And additionally, we will be involving drone hobbyists around
the country to start actively capturing data from their hometowns to send us
for analysis. We will be focusing on the Finnish market which has a lot of
potential. In our survey, over 60% of the landowners were interested in starting
to use these kind of technology in their operations. And the average customer
was already willing to pay over 750 euros per year, even though they didn’t
have any additional knowledge on the topic yet. So the traction for the first
one and two months we’re planning the idea, now pitching it, then moving on
to the marketing and portfolio building phase. And the idea is that for the
first six months we do it basically for free, planning to build reputation and our
portfolio. And then after that six months we start to do the payment-based
services and scaling up in that sense and then during the off-season we would
diversify. There’s our team which I would compress as a strong team with lots of
talent. There’s the competition and the main competition is divided into three
parts. So the private drone pilots, the precision farming solutions and then the
large companies and traditional tech solutions. And there’s a list of the other
competition more specified and then the stuff that we bring in. So reliability,
ease of use, low cost, clear pricing, customization of services and value. This
is according to our CFO. So one year or full year in operation we’d have four
employees, 163 customers. The set price is 21.3 euros per hectare and the
revenue of 170 000, which means a 23 profit margin. And we’re looking for an
investment of 150 000 euros. We’re supporting Finnish nature, food production,
agriculture and yeah. Thank you. Okay, so now we have...

he presentation. As you saw in the video, we are a platform which connects
service providers with service seekers. Minna is here. She’s going to talk about
Pursealtest features, market opportunities, and some overview on our competitors. Minna, please. Yeah. Hi, everyone. So, everyday customers struggle and
waste time to find reliable local professionals. While service providers face low
visibility and inefficient tools, the booming service economy is held back by fragmented platforms that fail to connect them seamlessly. So, Pursealta is a unified
marketplace for all types of professionals. For customers, we provide a place to
find professionals locally, to book appointments easily, post service requests,
and give reviews. Professionals can create detailed profiles, take an access to a
booking system, and they can receive customer requests and generate quotes.
And Finland is the perfect launch market for Pursealta. The Finnish service
economy is worth over 40 billion annually. There are over 300,000 small service
providers and freelancers in Finland alone. If we capture only 1% of Finland’s
service providers, 3,000 users, we could generate over 360,000 euros annually
from subscriptions alone. Our competitors are focused only on specific fields,
for example, beauty care or renovations. We serve all industries and professionals. We are affordable for small businesses. Our model is easily scalable and...
Yeah, sorry. And Aras will tell you more about our earning models. Thank
you, Minna, for the excellent introduction to Pursealta, its features and market
opportunities. Now, let me take you through our revenue model and explain
why Pursealta is a solid investment. Pursealta’s revenue model is designed to
be simple, scalable, and sustainable. So, in the first year, we plan to take just
a hundred professional accounts. We expect to generate approximately about
16,000 euros in the revenue from subscriptions, bids, and bookings. By the second year, if we go through 500 professionals, the total revenue could reach about
95,700 euros annually. So, why do we need your support? To bring Pursealta
to life and make it successful, we need your support to finalize our platform
development, execute marketing, and execute targeted marketing campaigns to
attract some service providers and also customers. And our third goal is to
expand our platform’s reach. So, with just 10,000 euros in funding, we can
unlock the 40 million Finnish service economy and set Pursealta on a path to
become a trusted platform for local services. Here’s our team. Our team brings
a diverse set of skills and shared passion for solving this problem. Together,
we’re committed to making Pursealta a game-changing platform for local services in Finland and beyond. Thank you all for your attention and time. With
Pursealta, we’re building a solution that simplifies connections and empowers
local service providers. We welcome your questions and your feedback if you
got any. Thank you.

 Coontent

 1.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 We hope this was sufficient for a brief introduction into our projects, but now
 let’s open the barrel and jump right into the details. So we envision Coontent
 as a dedicated member of your marketing team. Kuntend deals with all the boring tasks such as writing copy, publishing campaigns on the various platforms
 and analyzing their performances. You can think of him as a marketing expert
 who collaborates directly with your marketing team by doing all the dirty work
 for you. The benefits you gain from Kuntend are completely game-changing.
 Kuntend revolutionizes your marketing process by allowing you to save a significant time and money while also delivering high-quality results. What once took
 hours of human efforts can now be accomplished within just 10 minutes. So
 you can focus on the important parts such as coming up with ideas or marketing strategies. Kuntend is a business-to-business software-as-a-service platform
 specifically designed for marketing departments and agencies. We offer a subscription model with various tiers and plans tailored to your needs. Our local
 market research and customer interviews reveal a huge demand for marketing
 support i Bolzano. With over 50 marketing agencies only in Bolzano, there is a
 great demand for online marketing assistance here in this region. And Kuntend
 fits this demand perfectly by supporting marketing agencies and departments
 reaching their global audience. Let’s talk about how it works. Behind the
 scenes, Kuntend uses a huge collection of prompt snippets that are dynamically
 assembled to craft a custom prompt tailored to your specific campaign. You
 simply select your campaign goal, define the type of text you want, and in the
 end choose your publishing platform. And with this, Kuntend can create highquality copy following a fully guided process where everything is delivered to
 you within a delightful user interface. So there’s no way to screw it up. Okay,
 so in the beginning, we had a look at some possible competitors on the market. And we have seen that even though some of these tools allow the creation
 of content via generative AI, they usually simply copied the chat window of
 chat GPT. This meant that you had to write the prompt yourself. Because of
 this, generally, GPT works with garbage in and garbage out, meaning that if a
 prompt is bad, also the output will be bad. Kuntend solves this issue by doing
 the prompting for you in the background, so you don’t have to worry about
 it. Also, we’ve seen that most of these tools do the planning and management
 aspect more than they do anything else. So because of this, we created an allround solution that allows you the planning, but also the, let’s say, the writing,
 the publishing, and the analyzing of campaigns all in one platform. Also, our
 plans are that in the last few months, we have seen that by creating an initial
 proof of concept and turning it into reality, we have also had some interviews

 4

 with local industry experts, and they have shown us some ways to how we can
 improve and refine our product. Because of this, we want to launch our product
 in early 2025, and then expand beyond South Tyrell into more and larger, into
 larger markets. Our team is composed by Elias Binder and Daniel Pinochart.
 We are both AI enthusiasts and software engineering students, and we are also
 backed by an industry expert called Andreas Inammer, who is a copywriter and
 gives us some insight into the market. So now it’s time for you to skyrocket your
 online marketing with Kuntend. Just join our waiting list now on kuntend.io
 and follow us on our journey on how we create this software. Thank you very
 much.

 Whopika

 2.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 Learniness hurts the heart, and not just metaphorically. According to a study
 published in Repubblica, such an isolation and lack of close friendships increase
 the risk of heart disease and stroke by around 30%. Our solution, Cupica.
 Cupica is an application that helps people to build real connections. Whether
 you’re searching for a hiking partner, a soccer team, or simply someone to share
 your interest with, Cupica makes it easy. The app connects people through
 shared interests, creating real friendships and strong communities. A study
 published in 2024 showed that 52Italians feel an increase in social distancing,
 and almost 50% of them is aged between 25 and 34. With our interviews,
 we discovered that the ones who struggle the most in finding new friends are
 workers, especially those who move to a new city. And for those who come from
 abroad, another barrier is the language. So with 2.4% of Italians and 3.3% of
 Europeans that relocate yearly for working purposes and so have to rebuild their
 circle of friends, the market potential for Cupica is huge. This data represents
 a concrete opportunity for Cupica. Ok, so what about our users? We aim to
 build a strong sense of community and inclusion, providing a general-purpose
 tool for organizing and finding activities. And we also take care about people
 from different cultures and languages. Taking a look at our competition, we can
 find friends finding applications and activity-specific applications, but none of
 them cares about integrating different languages, support for inclusivity, and on
 top of that, you have to have one single application for each different activity
 you would like to pursue. So what about our plan? We are in the ending
 phase of the validation. In the next three months, we plan to release an MVP,
 gathering feedback and creating initial traction. On the six-month mark, we
 plan to release a beta version with pivotal features for Cupica, being the group
 discovery and the event creation feature. About revenue, we plan to release
 an initial free plan application, where unlimited event participation is offered,
 and the creation and management of one single event. To create more events
 or use the built-in chat, there is a premium plan, in order to let’s say avoid
 associations to promote their business through our free product. This is our
 team, this is Alice, the creative part of the team, I’m Dylan, more oriented on
 the technical aspect, and we bring to Cupica our experience. We both work
 in an international environment, we both had to relocate for study and work,
 and on top of that, we practice team sports, so we need people to do it with.
 So what are you waiting for? Please invest in Cupica, share with friends and
 family, and download the application. Thank you.

 Serenity

 3.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 Good morning everyone. Stress is a daily struggle mostly for us students and
 young professionals because we have to juggle our very busy time schedule in the
 week and month. And existing solutions often feel time-consuming, impersonal
 or intimidating, coming from the growing social anxiety in this generation. In
 the EU in 2021 almost one in five deaths among those aged 15 to 29 was registered as intentional self-harm, as shown in the Eurostat study. And that’s where
 our solution comes in, Serenity, a dynamic mental well-being platform that is
 targeted specifically for young adults. But Serenity isn’t just an application, in
 fact it is more of a personal companion that gives the user the possibility to take
 charge of their own mental health by providing the tools that fit seamlessly into
 their lives. So Serenity acts as a supplementary tool to traditional counselling
 and it offers anonymous 24-7 support for mental health, relaxation, stress reducing and it overall just promotes well-being. So leveraging the AI-driven insights,
 Serenity provides three main features. We have a personalized mood tracking
 7

 and analytics, then also personalized wellness resources that includes for example mindfulness exercises, self-care routines and stress relief techniques, and then
 we also have a responsive AI-powered chatbot that is obviously available 24-7
 to talk to the user. So we actually also got to analyze the potential competitors
 that we have on our market and we saw that compared to our application they
 focus more on lengthy sessions and general mindfulness, so what they do is they
 take the traditional approach and digitalize it somehow. We wanted to take a
 completely new approach by making Serenity quick and discreet. So taking a
 look at the market share we like to address, a study showed us that in 2023 the
 market for mental wellness applications was of 139.9 billion dollars and it is forecasted to grow to 216.8 billion dollars in 2030. So how do we plan our revenue?
 As also other teams showed we structure it in two plans, a free plan which has
 limited features like chatting time or also default reminders and a premium plan
 which will cost 4.99 euro and which gives the user in-depth analysis, unlimited
 chatting time and also custom reminders for activities. What is our roadmap?
 First we would like to create an MVP with basic tools and mood tracking. In
 the second phase we would like to introduce the advanced analytics part which
 helps the user identifying further problems and in phase three we would like
 to partner with wellness organizations to make our audience larger and reach
 more customers. Yeah this is us Marco and me Lisa, the team behind Serenity.
 We’re both very passionate about creating a world where wellness is accessible,
 relatable and also empowering for young adults. Thank you for letting us share
 our vision with you today and we would love to answer any questions that you
 might have.

 Sundove

 4.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 and today we are going to present Sundar. We believe that our romantic relationship is the most important aspect of our life, and being in a relationship, a
 great relationship, fills our life with happiness. We found that problems arise in
 couples when they have different expectations, and they are not communicated
 properly. According to a study of 30,000 people, the most common issue for 80%
 of them is communication problems. We spoke to couples and learned that communication is not easy, especially communicating our thoughts and feelings. We
 are not taught from young how to do this. Couple therapy is an existing solution, but nearly 60% of couples think that their problems are not serious enough
 for therapy. That’s why we want to help couples improve their relationship in a
 more accessible way by developing intentional communication. Intentional communication is expressing thoughts, feelings and needs purposefully, thoughtfully
 and with clarity. And we believe that intentional communication can be trained
 by having deep conversation. That is why we are creating Sundarv, a mobile application that offers curated courses on important topics that inspire couples to
 discover more about each other and uncover questions that they never thought
 about. We have here a snippet of a course covering the topic Navigating Conflict
 as a Couple. This includes informative materials and exercises with thoughtprovoking questions that the couple themselves can work on together. Just like
 how a fitness app can help us improve our physical health but not do the work
 for us, Sundarv aims to support a couple’s relationship by guiding them through
 deep conversations. This will be especially useful for couples who are looking
 forward and preparing their next stage in life, be it marriage, moving in or
 starting a new family together. Couples do not need to have a serious problem
 in their relationship to be able to benefit from this. To test our approach, we
 have built a simple, minimum viable experience using the same topic. In this
 MVE, couples will go through the material, review their past, present and future ways to handle conflict and talk about it together. Through this MVE, we
 want to understand if this is valuable to other couples. We publish it on Notion

 9

 and are working to gather feedback on it from relevant communities. We are
 still at the very early stages, but we are planning to develop our solution with
 an in-app purchase model, where couples can access different types of courses,
 where there are foundational ones that are free of charge and advanced ones for
 which the price will vary. The most common competitors are other apps for
 couples and more traditional ways such as books or couple therapy. We found
 that apps tend to remain very much surface level, while books lack the engagement of more modern media. And couple therapy, unfortunately, is not always
 accessible in terms of cost and access to qualified professionals. With Sandov,
 we aim to hit a sweet spot of depth, accessibility and engagement. The team
 working on Sandov is composed of Cristal and Matteo, myself. While we have
 expertise in software development, we are passionate about our love and couple
 relationships. We are learning a lot and we want to share these useful insights
 through Sandov. Finally, we are looking for a collaboration with experts in the
 field of relationship psychology. Thanks for your time and attention, and if you
 have any questions or feedback, we are happy to hear from you.

 Fitly

 5.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 Have you ever thought about how can I easily choose an outfit quickly without
 wearing it on and to have a look how it will look like on me? We have a solution
 for you. Introducing Fitly, your personal stylist right in your pocket ready to
 show you the perfect outfit for you based on your personal suggestions. The
 only thing you need to do is you need to upload clothes from your wardrobe
 or select them from our database and our assistant can generate can generate
 all the outfits for you. For the validation part, initially we thought about two
 target groups, fashion-oriented people and casual dressers. But after taking the
 interview, we realized that casual dressers are not interested in spending time on
 choosing outfits. Our app is not necessary for them. Our market and first target
 region we will focus on is going to be Europe, especially because we understand
 the Europe regulations and the laws. The projected AI fashion tech growth
 in the years till 2030 is going to be about 35we looked at, approximately 118
 million fashion-oriented individuals will be where we’re considering people we’re
 considering themselves fashion-oriented individuals in 2023. Yes, our customer
 analysis, so we expect the majority of our customers to be women between the
 ages of 16 till 44. Those we expect to use our application the most and the
 occasion-based planning time depends on the occasion that they are preparing
 themselves for. And for our revenue plan, for the free tier we would offer limited
 outfit suggestions and confined wardrobe style and some basic personalized options. Whereas by using the premium version, a customer could use unlimited
 outfit suggestions, more advanced personalization and deeper customization together with for a broader customer support and early access to new features.
 Currently our project revolves around the problem validation that was being
 spoken by my previous colleague and also problem solution fit that we were
 doing in our team Lean Canvas. In the next six months we expect to launch
 the minimum viable product with essential features, gather user feedback and
 build initial traction to be used for the next iterations of our product. And
 the next year we hopefully would scale the product, improve the features and
 expand the user base. And our teams consist of me, Justyna, my colleagues
 Katarina and Andrey. And while we don’t have much experience in fashion
 industry, we do believe that that doesn’t stop us from creating a useful product
 in this area. We kindly invite you in joining and revolutionizing the way people
 choose their outfits and partnering with us and being a part of a personalized
 and sustainable fashion future.

 Math4Me

 6.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 I start the presentation. My name is Paolo Peroni. I’m a designer. Math4Me
 is the solution to give parents who are concerned about their children’s math
 difficulties the real chance to put their children in a position to do well. Imagine
 you are 12 years old. You struggle with math. Your friends do well. Their
 parents are proud. But you don’t. And your parents look worried for your
 future. According to UNESCO, 60% of our students don’t reach the minimum
 acceptable level in math. In the European community and in Italy, 35% of
 students in high school don’t perform well. From 20 to 30% of families cannot
 afford a private tutor. And this is a problem. Those kids lose self-esteem. They
 12

 are excluded by their friends. And we noticed this during our interviews. They
 are afraid of limited future opportunities. Math4Me is a new learning system
 based by interactive lessons. It keeps tracking of the progress of the student. It
 uses gimmified elements. And it uses cooperative learning with schoolmates. It
 works because it adapts to each child’s learning pace. It’s not just about solving
 problems. It’s about rebuilding their confidence. We made some interviews to
 collect data from a math teacher, a student and his father. We received positive
 and interesting feedback from them, which encouraged our research. In Italy,
 the economic income deriving from e-learning is growing rapidly. And from
 the forecast, it would seem that it will continue to do so for the coming years.
 Furthermore, in Italy, this system could be a market necessity and could involve
 up to half of the students in our target. The target customer is the parent who
 purchases our product and installs it on his or her son or daughter’s devices.
 It is a little early to set a precise price at this stage, but certainly a paper-use
 model will be used. Thank you for the attention. I’m Math4Me.

 CampoRapido

 7.1

 Transcript of the pitch

 Welcome everyone, we are Elevate Team and we’re going to present Campo
 Rapido, which is our new digital solution for revolutionizing sports facility bookings. First of all, we’re going to present the problem and as we can see, this
 problem of bookings, sports facilities, it’s both a problem from the client side,
 so the people that want to book for playing and the people that manage the
 facilities. In our case, we’re going to focus for the people that are managing the
 facilities and as we can see on the top, we have this little figure that represents
 the person that is in charge.
 So right now we have disconnected calendars, plank interfaces and lack of
 insights, that’s main problems, mainly because all the bookings is done manually
 and on paper, so these problems are a consequential part of it. So what we
 propose? We propose the solution, which is a digital platform, which is called
 Campo Rapido and it’s a digital booking platform, so basically the person that
 is in charge of the fields is able to manage all the bookings on his phone or
 laptop and is going to have an advanced algorithm that basically displays some
 dashboard with some insights, basically like money earned or like changing the
 timetable if they have to maintain the field and so on, and this will produce a
 seamless experience for the manager.
 So right now these are all words, basically it’s a method if you feel the experience yourself. Regional booking methods are inefficient, often involving phone
 calls, emails and in-person visits. The sports field booking system is problematic
 due to the owner’s frequent availability and reliance on a paper-based system.
 We need to explore digital alternatives for smoother operations. Facilities lose
 revenue due to underutilized resources and lost booking. Unreliable booking processes leading to confusion and frustration of the facility owners. They deserve a
 streamlined transparent process. Campo Rapido is here, revolutionizing sports
 field bookings, digital booking platform, just a seamless experience, connecting
 sports facilities with athletes, real-time availability and secure payments.

 Rideshare

 8.1

 Transcript

 Okay, so let’s start. Good morning, we are the Blue.team and today we are
 going to present our product, Rideshare, and we would like to start with a short
 video. Okay, so let’s start. Okay, so let’s start. So, as we’ve seen from the
 video, moving inside the city can be a struggle for many different reasons, and
 even if you own a car and you don’t have this problem, then there are other
 issues that occur, such as spending a lot of time stuck in traffic or searching
 for a parking spot, and there are expenses for fuel and car maintenance. Of
 course, these problems occur mainly in areas where the public transportation
 and or the bike infrastructures are lacking or in existence, because if you live in
 Bolsan you don’t have this problem, and in those areas then also the problem of
 traffic and of searching for parking is increased. Yeah, so we decided we wanted
 to propose a ridesharing solution, and this is meant mainly for short distances
 and possibly repeated commutes, and you have two sides, so on the rider’s side
 you would be able to book a ride from a list of verified users, whereas from
 the driver’s side you would be able to publish your ride and therefore monetize
 commutes that you would perform anyway, and the magic is that it’s of course
 all in one place, so you have one platform to do finding, publishing, verifying,
 in-app payment, you don’t have to use many platforms for that, and of course
 the way we want to monetize this is by using a transaction-based model, so
 we would collect a 10% fee off of the transactions from the rider’s side, and of
 course we want to monetize our insights and our data to help local businesses.
 15

 So our main competitors are Efficient Town Management, because of course
 if you have a bus that works very well, and if you can ride around the city
 with your bike then you don’t need our service. There are other companies, for
 example BlaBlaCar, that offer car-sharing, carpooling services, but those are
 aimed for long-distance commutes. So to validate our idea we created, as for
 an MVP, two spotted-like Instagram pages, and we’ve learned that doing social
 media is very time-consuming and requires a lot of effort. However, there are
 other spotted-like accounts that are mainly focused on university environments,
 and in those accounts there are a lot of requests on a weekly basis asking for
 commutes, or searching for rides, or offering rides. So also those validate our

 Gentlemen, I see we’re a little bit tired. So yeah, Qualtech, that’s Qualtech. We
 are a software company that aims to deliver the most cutting edge industrial
 monitoring solutions for companies. Our first use case that we’re presenting
 today is specifically focused on methane leak detection. Companies around the
 world are losing billions of dollars due to methane leaks. But aside from financial losses, it also has a severe impact on our environments and our ecology. So
 to this day, about 30% of global warming is attributed to methane emissions.
 What is our solution? Our solution is an AI and software bundle that integrates
 seamlessly with the latest optical gas imaging technology, which allows the companies to easily quantify the leak, detect it earlier, and provide 24-7 monitoring.
 The market size for this solution is immense and it continues to grow. Worldwide, the market for industrial monitoring is estimated at around 18 billion US
 dollars, but it continues to grow at a steady rate of around 11, 12%. For the
 first five years, we want to focus specifically on methane gas and we expect to
 make off of that around, well, over a million euro by year five in revenue. So
 we’ve already introduced the product, the Duriq. Here’s a tablet where you
 can get familiar with the interface. Look around, play around with it. And the
 best part is we already have traction. We have a global distribution partner,
 Pyram Gamitalia, who are willing to buy our licensing for 600 euro per license
 per camera. And we’ve already, and we’ve spoken with one of the largest gas
 companies in Germany, and they said that they are piloting a similar solution.
 So there’s a clear demand, there’s a clear need for what we’re trying to solve.
 We’re a team of five, but we are looking for AI and machine learning experts.
 There is massive competition in the market. There are three main companies
 who control most of the market at the moment, but we estimate that because
 we are optimizing due to our accuracy and due to process optimization, we can
 save our customers anywhere from 180,000 euro to over a million euro annually.
 Some key metrics. We believe that as soon as we start retailing 282 licenses
 per annum, we’re going to start operating at a break-even level. We expect to
 generate a total revenue of over 1 million annually by year 10. And by year
 six, when we enter the wider industrial monitoring market, we would have a
 retail earnings of 60,000. Our starting price, we’re going to start off with a flat
 fee of 600 euro per camera per license. But in year six, we plan to shift to a
 SaaS model when we start operating in a wider market. We need 100,000, we
 need 190,000 euro. Most of it will go to research and development and labor
 expenses, because that’s based on the comparables analysis that we did during
 our research. And for the first five years, we don’t need to retain Salesforce
 because, well, we have a partner who can go out and do it.

 Great, so I will take over now to tell you a little bit more about AssistMe. My
 name is Tytti, I’m the CEO of AssistMe and I am very excited to share you
 about our product. You can go to the next slide. And the next one from here.
 So AssistMe is a new kind of enterprise productivity app and our mission is to
 reduce the mental load to increase productivity by helping people stay on their
 tasks and making it easier for them to manage their professional and private
 life. So we’re more geared towards these busy professionals that are having a
 hard time managing all of their calendars, all of their assignments and this is
 what we are here to do. So for the problems, what we have seen validated by our
 18

 survey data is that a lot of people still struggle with managing their meetings,
 prioritizing their tasks, staying on top of their goals and planning their day-today life and we are here to provide a solution for that. So what our product
 is going to do is to provide you with smarter ways to schedule your meetings
 and create follow-ups, also providing automated transcripts for you to take the
 mental load off of creating meeting notes and for you to share and customize
 your calendars and adjust your availability. We’re helping people to also to
 achieve their goals by this AI chat assistant that will make it take the mental
 load off your shoulders and moving it into a smarter way of working. We see
 that there is a huge demand for this service still since a lot of meetings are still
 happening in person in addition to the ones online. For instance, in the US, as
 you can see, there’s almost three meetings per day for a lot of people and many
 people are still using regular paper calendars and we want to provide them with
 a digital first opportunity to manage their time. Looking at the market size,
 we can see that the productivity market is currently valued at 5.7 billion in
 2023 and it’s expected to have a steady growth rate up to 2030. There is still a
 lot of growth happening and this is driven by the digitalization of professional
 and private life. Based on our business model, we offer two different kinds of
 subscriptions. The other one would be a free version with certain limitations
 to the features available and our main focus will be on the enterprise version,
 which is offering 20 users for 350 euros per month and this will also have some
 additional features for our enterprise customers. Of course, the freemium model
 allows you to share your calendar with your loved ones, which makes it easier
 for you to manage your time with your family and keep them up to date with
 your life. What we’re seeing based on our research on our competitors is that
 especially our enterprise model will offer a very wide range of features that are
 not available in the free version.

 So firstly, we wanted to, coming into university, being a first year, facing the
 first problem almost immediately was that disorganization, so currently if you
 look at a university student’s journey when you wake up in the morning and
 you have to figure out what exactly am I meant to do today, you have to go
 to basically 10 different places, five of which work on your phone, three only
 work on your laptop, you’re going to Moodle, you’re going to something else.
 As a basic MVP, we’re trying to organize all of that into one place so that
 you basically have one interface where you know what exactly I have to do on
 today, basically. So currently the existing solutions out there are you have like
 your Google Calendar, your notes, if you look at some of those, that’s what
 my Moodle looked like on a day when I had five classes, sort of. It says I have
 nothing to do. If you switch here, this is where the problem comes in, is that
 there are things that I can add my calendar to, but I have to go through this,
 which is clunky and archaic and something that you really need to sit down
 and have a next level degree of consciousness, conscientiousness to be able to
 do consistently. So instead, we’re shifting this input format into something that
 all of us can do, which is language. So essentially you kind of just tell your app
 the way you would describe it to a chat GPT. Okay, I’ve got this, this and this,
 something you remember on the bus, you just type it in. I’ve got a meeting at
 five o’clock and boom, you have it in your calendar. So we describe it as like
 talking to a friend who listens, remembers, and ultimately helps you get things
 done. This is more of the idealized product, whereas the basic is really, the
 MVP is really just an input in through language and an output out through
 a scheduling app. But eventually down the line, we want to add gamification
 features. We want to integrate with university backends so we can get their
 data and you can kind of import data from Moodle that’s further down the line.
 We want to start in the Finnish market. And given that we are in a

 Shieldskin. My name is Valentin and I’m happy to start now for our presentation. First of all we would look at our product again so you get a closer shot.
 One thing we mentioned in the video that’s very very important is that we’ve
 got protectors on the shoulders, in the back and as well on the elbows and you
 can remove them and wear the jacket in a day-to-day casual environment as
 well. We’ve got more designs. The one on the left is one very special exclusive
 design and you get an impression of our product. Our social mission we mentioned as well. I want to stress that because it’s really important to us. We
 21

 use leather waste to produce new gloves and gift them to people for free here in
 Finland. Looking at our business. First of all riding a motorcycle is extremely
 dangerous so people need protection and they want it as well usually. However
 motorcycle jackets often are very very bulky and are not convenient. You can’t
 wear them in normal environments usually and they tend to be very expensive
 and this is the issue we are solving. Who are our customers? Go back please.
 Our customers are motorcyclists aging 18 to 35 and they want protection and
 as well convenience to wear them in normal day-to-day life and they have a
 sense for style. Our plans. We are starting here in Finland. We’re gonna set
 up the business make it profitable and after presumably one year we’ll expand
 to Sweden building infrastructure for expansion and in the third year we’ll go
 to Europe to the bigger markets. Looking at our financials for the first two
 years we’ll be starting in Finland and then by the end of the first year we hope
 to get a market share of about 2.6% and with a revenue of 314,000 euros we
 are looking to return to our investors 58.9% of the investment with a profit of
 60,602 euros. Then expanding to Sweden by the second year we hope to have a
 combined market share of 4.87% and with a revenue of 950,000 euros returning
 for investors 330% and a profit of 282,000 euros. Now looking at our competitors we have Polo Motorrad and their prices ranges between 350 and 550 euros
 while the jacket maker Diaz ranges between 280 and 350 euros and then what
 stands us apart is affordability. Our product is going to be having a price of
 229.4 euros including VAT and our quality is top-notch and then we have the
 social welfare expert and sustainability attached to it and the team is made up
 of me, the chief

 So, hi everyone. So we are a team of sauna lovers, just like you and me. I’m
 sharing joining me today is Yuga. So, imagine, finding and reserving a unique
 sauna experience as easy as reserving a hotel room on booking.com. That’s
 sauna you and me. It’s a one-stop digital hub for everything sauna, from traditional smoking sauna to floating adventure. But finding, like this one, floating
 sauna, but finding a perfect sauna or just a sauna you want can be a hassle. Like
 Daniel in the video, many face endless hours researching, and skater booking
 system, confusing payment options. There’s no single platform to make everything easy, leaving many sauna lovers like you and me confused, overwhelming,
 and underserved. The solution, sauna you and me is the solution. It’s a super
 app or website, make stop booking and finding sauna easy and simple. You
 can discover, compare, book, pay, all in one single place. It’s faster, it’s user
 friendly, and it’s designed to give you unforgettable sauna experience. In Finland, there are more than 2 million saunas, with 70, 90% of Finns using sauna
 weekly, 40% of them using sauna multiple times per week. And the global sauna
 market is growing. Wellness tourism is a $900 billion industry. According to
 our survey, more than 70% of our responders are eager to book their sauna experience digitally. So we start in Finland, and we are ready to scale worldwide.
 Then our main revenue stream would be commission fee, as our competitors
 or similar platforms are also doing. And we would also include listing fees as
 like a premium package for having like more visibility. And then other revenue
 stream would be advertisement shown in our site. And comparing us to our
 competitors, they usually don’t have integrated bookings or doesn’t cover all
 types of saunas in one place. They have like one type only or might be limited
 to only capital region in Finland. And they have, all of them only have like
 web page and they have like no mobile app. And some of them even lacking
 English version, many of them have, but some of them are lacking still. And
 presenting our team. So Shirin is our CEO and kind of ideator behind of this.
 And Daniel is our CMO and I’m CFO. And Anja is our CTO. And here’s how

 23

 some projections, how we will grow. And we are expected that we will make
 profit third year. So we’ll be realistic with that. That’s the main key takeaway
 here. And what are we seeking? We are seeking funding for 55,000 seed funding
 in exchange of 10% equity, which will help us scale the platform further. And
 we are looking at partnerships like local sauna providers and tourism boards
 to enhance our offerings. And we are also looking team members like customer
 specialists and data analysts. And kind of, yeah, more people, people with more
 knowledge basically. And that’s it. Thank you.

 Transcript

 So, everybody, welcome to MatchIT, revolutionary recruitment platform for IT
 companies. What was the idea behind? We all face this situation when there is
 limited HR resources, inaccurate job requirements, and in this way, hiring becoming a very risky process. You don’t understand everything what companies
 want from you and companies, in turn, do not understand what to expect from
 people. And this is a big problem. Solution? MatchIT. It is a platform for job
 seekers to show their real skill level and confirm it. MatchIT provides skill-based
 evaluation of candidates and MatchIT brings trust between candidates because
 companies will be able to see their real skills and real experience. And in turn,
 for companies, because the people will be able to see the trusted reviews for the
 companies and their real offerings and not the lies you can find, for instance,
 on other platforms. Market is very big and most importantly, it’s very scalable.
 Only on the Finnish market, there is 137,000 employees in the ICT sector and
 33,000 new hirings in 2023. It is an amazing scalability for EU market because
 there is 9.8 million specialists in the ICT sector. Now let’s take a look what does
 it mean to us? How can we bring money? How can we bring value? The value
 is brought by the experience and understanding of the situation. We’ve been
 asking people from different industries like HR, coders and also developers and
 they showed that there is a need for the platform where everything is united.
 All services under one ecosystem and problem extend well to selling consultants
 and it will be very easy to compare skills directly. So there is an old way of
 hiring. There is DooneyTory and Jobly where you can see the ads and that’s
 mostly it. And there is a new way of hiring, the LeadCode and HackerRank
 and others, where you can access skills of employees, but at the same time, you
 can ensure there is no connection between them. And in this way, the combined
 way is MatchIT, when there is both confirmed skills and information about the
 work and links. So the process, for instance, for DooneyTory to hire one person
 for the company costs 2,500 euros. We are offering a cost cap of 1,000 euros and
 in three years, we’re aiming for a minimum market share of 1.5% in Finland,
 around 500 persons per year. And in this case, after four years, our net present
 value will exceed 300,000 euros. Amazing numbers. And the scalability after
 these three years to the European market shows great results. And our fantastic
 team of four people of Emil, Matvei, Heikki and Joel is happy to invite you to
 invest into our project. We ask for 15,000 euros and we are ready to bargain,
 offering 10% of the share in our company. But this is just the start. So you can
 see what we want and how we’ll implement it. So the decision is yours. Thank
 you.

 Transcript

 We are PolyGlobe and we are here to change the way people learn languages.
 Imagine stepping into a virtual cafe in Paris or navigating a train station in
 Tokyo all while practicing a local language. With PolyGlobe we bring immersive
 gamified learning experiences to life, making language learning more effective,
 engaging, and fun. So language learning today has three big problems. First,
 learners often struggle to imply what they have learned in real life. Second,
 speaking a new language can feel intimidating, creating a fear of making mistakes. And third, most methods today are hard and boring, leading many to
 quit before they achieve fluency. So our solution is PolyGlobe, a VR-based app
 that transforms language learning into an immersive adventure. We already
 created a rough prototype and we are ready to bring this to the global market
 with a lot of languages. Market size and opportunity. The language learning
 market is booming, valued at $61.5 billion in 2023 and expected to double by
 2031. Meanwhile, VR in education, worth $3.8 billion in 2023, is growing at
 an impressive 18% annually. PolyGlobe stands at the intersection of these two
 trends, offering an immersive gamified solution for students, travelers, with millions seeking better ways to learn languages. And the opportunity is vast and
 growing. Okay, and on this slide you can see a quick overview of our team.
 Then you can go on to the next slide. PolyGlobe operates in a competitive
 space with huge players like Duolingo and many others. However, what sets
 us apart is the immersive VR experience that places learners directly into realworld scenarios, encouraging them to speak the language. Then you can go on
 to the next slide. While competitors like Duolingo gamify language learning,
 PolyGlobe goes a step further by incorporating social features, allowing users
 to practice in a virtual community. This creates a more engaging and practical
 learning environment which traditional apps can’t offer. Yeah, and then here
 31

 you can see a matrix on where we are compared to our competitors. Then the
 next slide. In our first year, we aim to reach 30,000 users, leveraging the growing
 VR adoption rate of 120 million global users. With a planned ramp-up growth
 model, our first-year revenue is estimated at 49,000. On the cost side, initial
 platform and app development will require 300,000, followed by 50,000 monthly
 updates and hosting expenses. Overall first-year costs total to 420,000. We are
 confident that with user acquisition growth, we’ll achieve a strong foundation
 for scaling revenue and impact. We are seeking 500,000 in funding for software
 development, launching a marketing campaign, and to acquire users. Our key
 milestones include launching a beta within six months, acquiring 30,000 users
 in year one, and scaling our immersive scenarios. PolyGlobe is positioned at
 the cutting edge of VR education.

 Mediflow

 Transcript

 Today, Paul and I want to present Mediflow. So first, maybe some of you experience some of those pains when taking medicine. First, you are ill, you go
 to your medicine cabinet and you see, okay, the medicine that I want to take
 is expired. Next, when you found another medicine, you have to read through
 long descriptions in order to get to know how you have to consume the medicine.
 And finally, a few days later, you realize, okay, I forgot to take the pill in the
 morning. And the solution is Mediflow, and you just got to know our application through the video. So let’s have a look at the market. So actually, there’s a
 big market potential. On the left side, you can see the average pharmaceutical
 spendings of countries in Central Europe. And you can see that Germany is in
 the lead. And there’s also a quite big growth potential. There are also current
 trends that are beneficial for our Mediflow idea. First, people are getting older.
 And older people tend to have more illnesses. And also older people are becoming more familiar with the smartphones. Next, there’s also a health grant going
 on in Central Europe. And people consume more supplements. So our revenue
 streams will be affiliate links to online pharmacies. There will be premium features, as mentioned in the video. For example, you can book an appointment
 with health professionals. And there will also be in-app advertisement. So let’s
 have a look at our team. So our team consists of three motivated persons with
 backgrounds in business and also in IT. However, we need a programmer and
 also a UI designer to launch our startup. Let’s have a look at the competition.
 So actually, there are already pill notification apps. There are online pharmacies where you can buy the medicine. And there are also apps where you can
 book online appointments with health professionals. However, we are the all-inone solution. So our app combines all these features. And on addition to those
 features, we also have expiration tracking. People can see the medicine information, the most important medicine information at a glance. They can buy the
 medicine at the best price through affiliate links to several online pharmacies.
 And there will also be AI features. For example, you can take a picture of your
 prescription. And there will be automatically a treatment plan added to your
 user account. Okay, so this is our financial strategy. These indicators show how
 we are becoming profitable. While our cumulative cash flow starts negative due
 to investment in marketing and development, we reached the breakeven point
 between month 11 and month 12. Regarding the cash flow sufficiency index, we
 can see that even at the lowest point around month 7, we still are able to cover
 our operating costs of the next months. MediFlow is more than an investment
 opportunity. It’s a way to transform the healthcare market. We are operating on a fast-growing market with a result of real traction. We are looking for
 €250,000 that we will spend about 60% in marketing, 40% in development, and
 10in results. With your support, we aim to multiply your investments by five
 within five years. MediFlow is ready. We have the vision, we have the team,
 and we have the market. All we need is you. Invest in MediFlow today and
 33

 let’s simplify care together. Thank you.

 and we are bringing data-driven decision-making to forests, fields and farms
 with the help of growth. To increase production from forests, crop use from
 farms and efficiently managing land, gathering a single land level data is the
 direction forestry and agriculture industry are going towards. However, there
 is a large group of forest owners and farmers that are lacking information and
 they do not have enough financial resources to actively start using these trending
 technologies. And we are educating them, showing the actual value as well as
 34

 being part of these communities. Our service will offer a service without the
 customer not needing any equipment themselves and our end product will be
 easy to understand suggestions and reports based on their area and problematic
 parts especially. And additionally, we will be involving drone hobbyists around
 the country to start actively capturing data from their hometowns to send us
 for analysis. We will be focusing on the Finnish market which has a lot of
 potential. In our survey, over 60% of the landowners were interested in starting
 to use these kind of technology in their operations. And the average customer
 was already willing to pay over 750 euros per year, even though they didn’t
 have any additional knowledge on the topic yet. So the traction for the first
 one and two months we’re planning the idea, now pitching it, then moving on
 to the marketing and portfolio building phase. And the idea is that for the
 first six months we do it basically for free, planning to build reputation and our
 portfolio. And then after that six months we start to do the payment-based
 services and scaling up in that sense and then during the off-season we would
 diversify. There’s our team which I would compress as a strong team with lots of
 talent. There’s the competition and the main competition is divided into three
 parts. So the private drone pilots, the precision farming solutions and then the
 large companies and traditional tech solutions. And there’s a list of the other
 competition more specified and then the stuff that we bring in. So reliability,
 ease of use, low cost, clear pricing, customization of services and value. This
 is according to our CFO. So one year or full year in operation we’d have four
 employees, 163 customers. The set price is 21.3 euros per hectare and the
 revenue of 170 000, which means a 23 profit margin. And we’re looking for an
 investment of 150 000 euros. We’re supporting Finnish nature, food production,
 agriculture and yeah. Thank you. Okay, so now we have...

 he presentation. As you saw in the video, we are a platform which connects
 service providers with service seekers. Minna is here. She’s going to talk about
 Pursealtest features, market opportunities, and some overview on our competitors. Minna, please. Yeah. Hi, everyone. So, everyday customers struggle and
 waste time to find reliable local professionals. While service providers face low
 visibility and inefficient tools, the booming service economy is held back by fragmented platforms that fail to connect them seamlessly. So, Pursealta is a unified
 marketplace for all types of professionals. For customers, we provide a place to
 find professionals locally, to book appointments easily, post service requests,
 and give reviews. Professionals can create detailed profiles, take an access to a
 booking system, and they can receive customer requests and generate quotes.
 And Finland is the perfect launch market for Pursealta. The Finnish service
 economy is worth over 40 billion annually. There are over 300,000 small service
 providers and freelancers in Finland alone. If we capture only 1% of Finland’s
 service providers, 3,000 users, we could generate over 360,000 euros annually
 from subscriptions alone. Our competitors are focused only on specific fields,
 for example, beauty care or renovations. We serve all industries and professionals. We are affordable for small businesses. Our model is easily scalable and...
 Yeah, sorry. And Aras will tell you more about our earning models. Thank
 you, Minna, for the excellent introduction to Pursealta, its features and market
 opportunities. Now, let me take you through our revenue model and explain
 why Pursealta is a solid investment. Pursealta’s revenue model is designed to
 be simple, scalable, and sustainable. So, in the first year, we plan to take just
 a hundred professional accounts. We expect to generate approximately about
 16,000 euros in the revenue from subscriptions, bids, and bookings. By the second year, if we go through 500 professionals, the total revenue could reach about
 95,700 euros annually. So, why do we need your support? To bring Pursealta
 to life and make it successful, we need your support to finalize our platform
 development, execute marketing, and execute targeted marketing campaigns to
 attract some service providers and also customers. And our third goal is to
 expand our platform’s reach. So, with just 10,000 euros in funding, we can
 unlock the 40 million Finnish service economy and set Pursealta on a path to
 become a trusted platform for local services. Here’s our team. Our team brings
 a diverse set of skills and shared passion for solving this problem. Together,
 we’re committed to making Pursealta a game-changing platform for local services in Finland and beyond. Thank you all for your attention and time. With
 Pursealta, we’re building a solution that simplifies connections and empowers
 local service providers. We welcome your questions and your feedback if you
 got any. Thank you.

  Transcript of the pitch

  We hope this was sufficient for a brief introduction into our projects, but now
  let’s open the barrel and jump right into the details. So we envision Coontent
  as a dedicated member of your marketing team. Kuntend deals with all the boring tasks such as writing copy, publishing campaigns on the various platforms
  and analyzing their performances. You can think of him as a marketing expert
  who collaborates directly with your marketing team by doing all the dirty work
  for you. The benefits you gain from Kuntend are completely game-changing.
  Kuntend revolutionizes your marketing process by allowing you to save a significant time and money while also delivering high-quality results. What once took
  hours of human efforts can now be accomplished within just 10 minutes. So
  you can focus on the important parts such as coming up with ideas or marketing strategies. Kuntend is a business-to-business software-as-a-service platform
  specifically designed for marketing departments and agencies. We offer a subscription model with various tiers and plans tailored to your needs. Our local
  market research and customer interviews reveal a huge demand for marketing
  support i Bolzano. With over 50 marketing agencies only in Bolzano, there is a
  great demand for online marketing assistance here in this region. And Kuntend
  fits this demand perfectly by supporting marketing agencies and departments
  reaching their global audience. Let’s talk about how it works. Behind the
  scenes, Kuntend uses a huge collection of prompt snippets that are dynamically
  assembled to craft a custom prompt tailored to your specific campaign. You
  simply select your campaign goal, define the type of text you want, and in the
  end choose your publishing platform. And with this, Kuntend can create highquality copy following a fully guided process where everything is delivered to
  you within a delightful user interface. So there’s no way to screw it up. Okay,
  so in the beginning, we had a look at some possible competitors on the market. And we have seen that even though some of these tools allow the creation
  of content via generative AI, they usually simply copied the chat window of
  chat GPT. This meant that you had to write the prompt yourself. Because of
  this, generally, GPT works with garbage in and garbage out, meaning that if a
  prompt is bad, also the output will be bad. Kuntend solves this issue by doing
  the prompting for you in the background, so you don’t have to worry about
  it. Also, we’ve seen that most of these tools do the planning and management
  aspect more than they do anything else. So because of this, we created an allround solution that allows you the planning, but also the, let’s say, the writing,
  the publishing, and the analyzing of campaigns all in one platform. Also, our
  plans are that in the last few months, we have seen that by creating an initial
  proof of concept and turning it into reality, we have also had some interviews

  4

  with local industry experts, and they have shown us some ways to how we can
  improve and refine our product. Because of this, we want to launch our product
  in early 2025, and then expand beyond South Tyrell into more and larger, into
  larger markets. Our team is composed by Elias Binder and Daniel Pinochart.
  We are both AI enthusiasts and software engineering students, and we are also
  backed by an industry expert called Andreas Inammer, who is a copywriter and
  gives us some insight into the market. So now it’s time for you to skyrocket your
  online marketing with Kuntend. Just join our waiting list now on kuntend.io
  and follow us on our journey on how we create this software. Thank you very
  much.

  Transcript of the pitch

  Learniness hurts the heart, and not just metaphorically. According to a study
  published in Repubblica, such an isolation and lack of close friendships increase
  the risk of heart disease and stroke by around 30%. Our solution, Cupica.
  Cupica is an application that helps people to build real connections. Whether
  you’re searching for a hiking partner, a soccer team, or simply someone to share
  your interest with, Cupica makes it easy. The app connects people through
  shared interests, creating real friendships and strong communities. A study
  published in 2024 showed that 52Italians feel an increase in social distancing,
  and almost 50% of them is aged between 25 and 34. With our interviews,
  we discovered that the ones who struggle the most in finding new friends are
  workers, especially those who move to a new city. And for those who come from
  abroad, another barrier is the language. So with 2.4% of Italians and 3.3% of
  Europeans that relocate yearly for working purposes and so have to rebuild their
  circle of friends, the market potential for Cupica is huge. This data represents
  a concrete opportunity for Cupica. Ok, so what about our users? We aim to
  build a strong sense of community and inclusion, providing a general-purpose
  tool for organizing and finding activities. And we also take care about people
  from different cultures and languages. Taking a look at our competition, we can
  find friends finding applications and activity-specific applications, but none of
  them cares about integrating different languages, support for inclusivity, and on
  top of that, you have to have one single application for each different activity
  you would like to pursue. So what about our plan? We are in the ending
  phase of the validation. In the next three months, we plan to release an MVP,
  gathering feedback and creating initial traction. On the six-month mark, we
  plan to release a beta version with pivotal features for Cupica, being the group
  discovery and the event creation feature. About revenue, we plan to release
  an initial free plan application, where unlimited event participation is offered,
  and the creation and management of one single event. To create more events
  or use the built-in chat, there is a premium plan, in order to let’s say avoid
  associations to promote their business through our free product. This is our
  team, this is Alice, the creative part of the team, I’m Dylan, more oriented on
  the technical aspect, and we bring to Cupica our experience. We both work
  in an international environment, we both had to relocate for study and work,
  and on top of that, we practice team sports, so we need people to do it with.
  So what are you waiting for? Please invest in Cupica, share with friends and
  family, and download the application. Thank you.

  Serenity

  3.1

  Transcript of the pitch

  Good morning everyone. Stress is a daily struggle mostly for us students and
  young professionals because we have to juggle our very busy time schedule in the
  week and month. And existing solutions often feel time-consuming, impersonal
  or intimidating, coming from the growing social anxiety in this generation. In
  the EU in 2021 almost one in five deaths among those aged 15 to 29 was registered as intentional self-harm, as shown in the Eurostat study. And that’s where
  our solution comes in, Serenity, a dynamic mental well-being platform that is
  targeted specifically for young adults. But Serenity isn’t just an application, in
  fact it is more of a personal companion that gives the user the possibility to take
  charge of their own mental health by providing the tools that fit seamlessly into
  their lives. So Serenity acts as a supplementary tool to traditional counselling
  and it offers anonymous 24-7 support for mental health, relaxation, stress reducing and it overall just promotes well-being. So leveraging the AI-driven insights,
  Serenity provides three main features. We have a personalized mood tracking
  7

  and analytics, then also personalized wellness resources that includes for example mindfulness exercises, self-care routines and stress relief techniques, and then
  we also have a responsive AI-powered chatbot that is obviously available 24-7
  to talk to the user. So we actually also got to analyze the potential competitors
  that we have on our market and we saw that compared to our application they
  focus more on lengthy sessions and general mindfulness, so what they do is they
  take the traditional approach and digitalize it somehow. We wanted to take a
  completely new approach by making Serenity quick and discreet. So taking a
  look at the market share we like to address, a study showed us that in 2023 the
  market for mental wellness applications was of 139.9 billion dollars and it is forecasted to grow to 216.8 billion dollars in 2030. So how do we plan our revenue?
  As also other teams showed we structure it in two plans, a free plan which has
  limited features like chatting time or also default reminders and a premium plan
  which will cost 4.99 euro and which gives the user in-depth analysis, unlimited
  chatting time and also custom reminders for activities. What is our roadmap?
  First we would like to create an MVP with basic tools and mood tracking. In
  the second phase we would like to introduce the advanced analytics part which
  helps the user identifying further problems and in phase three we would like
  to partner with wellness organizations to make our audience larger and reach
  more customers. Yeah this is us Marco and me Lisa, the team behind Serenity.
  We’re both very passionate about creating a world where wellness is accessible,
  relatable and also empowering for young adults. Thank you for letting us share
  our vision with you today and we would love to answer any questions that you
  might have.

  Sundove

  4.1

  Transcript of the pitch

  and today we are going to present Sundar. We believe that our romantic relationship is the most important aspect of our life, and being in a relationship, a
  great relationship, fills our life with happiness. We found that problems arise in
  couples when they have different expectations, and they are not communicated
  properly. According to a study of 30,000 people, the most common issue for 80%
  of them is communication problems. We spoke to couples and learned that communication is not easy, especially communicating our thoughts and feelings. We
  are not taught from young how to do this. Couple therapy is an existing solution, but nearly 60% of couples think that their problems are not serious enough
  for therapy. That’s why we want to help couples improve their relationship in a
  more accessible way by developing intentional communication. Intentional communication is expressing thoughts, feelings and needs purposefully, thoughtfully
  and with clarity. And we believe that intentional communication can be trained
  by having deep conversation. That is why we are creating Sundarv, a mobile application that offers curated courses on important topics that inspire couples to
  discover more about each other and uncover questions that they never thought
  about. We have here a snippet of a course covering the topic Navigating Conflict
  as a Couple. This includes informative materials and exercises with thoughtprovoking questions that the couple themselves can work on together. Just like
  how a fitness app can help us improve our physical health but not do the work
  for us, Sundarv aims to support a couple’s relationship by guiding them through
  deep conversations. This will be especially useful for couples who are looking
  forward and preparing their next stage in life, be it marriage, moving in or
  starting a new family together. Couples do not need to have a serious problem
  in their relationship to be able to benefit from this. To test our approach, we
  have built a simple, minimum viable experience using the same topic. In this
  MVE, couples will go through the material, review their past, present and future ways to handle conflict and talk about it together. Through this MVE, we
  want to understand if this is valuable to other couples. We publish it on Notion

  9

  and are working to gather feedback on it from relevant communities. We are
  still at the very early stages, but we are planning to develop our solution with
  an in-app purchase model, where couples can access different types of courses,
  where there are foundational ones that are free of charge and advanced ones for
  which the price will vary. The most common competitors are other apps for
  couples and more traditional ways such as books or couple therapy. We found
  that apps tend to remain very much surface level, while books lack the engagement of more modern media. And couple therapy, unfortunately, is not always
  accessible in terms of cost and access to qualified professionals. With Sandov,
  we aim to hit a sweet spot of depth, accessibility and engagement. The team
  working on Sandov is composed of Cristal and Matteo, myself. While we have
  expertise in software development, we are passionate about our love and couple
  relationships. We are learning a lot and we want to share these useful insights
  through Sandov. Finally, we are looking for a collaboration with experts in the
  field of relationship psychology. Thanks for your time and attention, and if you
  have any questions or feedback, we are happy to hear from you.

  Fitly

  5.1

  Transcript of the pitch

  Have you ever thought about how can I easily choose an outfit quickly without
  wearing it on and to have a look how it will look like on me? We have a solution
  for you. Introducing Fitly, your personal stylist right in your pocket ready to
  show you the perfect outfit for you based on your personal suggestions. The
  only thing you need to do is you need to upload clothes from your wardrobe
  or select them from our database and our assistant can generate can generate
  all the outfits for you. For the validation part, initially we thought about two
  target groups, fashion-oriented people and casual dressers. But after taking the
  interview, we realized that casual dressers are not interested in spending time on
  choosing outfits. Our app is not necessary for them. Our market and first target
  region we will focus on is going to be Europe, especially because we understand
  the Europe regulations and the laws. The projected AI fashion tech growth
  in the years till 2030 is going to be about 35we looked at, approximately 118
  million fashion-oriented individuals will be where we’re considering people we’re
  considering themselves fashion-oriented individuals in 2023. Yes, our customer
  analysis, so we expect the majority of our customers to be women between the
  ages of 16 till 44. Those we expect to use our application the most and the
  occasion-based planning time depends on the occasion that they are preparing
  themselves for. And for our revenue plan, for the free tier we would offer limited
  outfit suggestions and confined wardrobe style and some basic personalized options. Whereas by using the premium version, a customer could use unlimited
  outfit suggestions, more advanced personalization and deeper customization together with for a broader customer support and early access to new features.
  Currently our project revolves around the problem validation that was being
  spoken by my previous colleague and also problem solution fit that we were
  doing in our team Lean Canvas. In the next six months we expect to launch
  the minimum viable product with essential features, gather user feedback and
  build initial traction to be used for the next iterations of our product. And
  the next year we hopefully would scale the product, improve the features and
  expand the user base. And our teams consist of me, Justyna, my colleagues
  Katarina and Andrey. And while we don’t have much experience in fashion
  industry, we do believe that that doesn’t stop us from creating a useful product
  in this area. We kindly invite you in joining and revolutionizing the way people
  choose their outfits and partnering with us and being a part of a personalized
  and sustainable fashion future.

  Math4Me

  6.1

  Transcript of the pitch

  I start the presentation. My name is Paolo Peroni. I’m a designer. Math4Me
  is the solution to give parents who are concerned about their children’s math
  difficulties the real chance to put their children in a position to do well. Imagine
  you are 12 years old. You struggle with math. Your friends do well. Their
  parents are proud. But you don’t. And your parents look worried for your
  future. According to UNESCO, 60% of our students don’t reach the minimum
  acceptable level in math. In the European community and in Italy, 35% of
  students in high school don’t perform well. From 20 to 30% of families cannot
  afford a private tutor. And this is a problem. Those kids lose self-esteem. They
  12

  are excluded by their friends. And we noticed this during our interviews. They
  are afraid of limited future opportunities. Math4Me is a new learning system
  based by interactive lessons. It keeps tracking of the progress of the student. It
  uses gimmified elements. And it uses cooperative learning with schoolmates. It
  works because it adapts to each child’s learning pace. It’s not just about solving
  problems. It’s about rebuilding their confidence. We made some interviews to
  collect data from a math teacher, a student and his father. We received positive
  and interesting feedback from them, which encouraged our research. In Italy,
  the economic income deriving from e-learning is growing rapidly. And from
  the forecast, it would seem that it will continue to do so for the coming years.
  Furthermore, in Italy, this system could be a market necessity and could involve
  up to half of the students in our target. The target customer is the parent who
  purchases our product and installs it on his or her son or daughter’s devices.
  It is a little early to set a precise price at this stage, but certainly a paper-use
  model will be used. Thank you for the attention. I’m Math4Me.

  CampoRapido

  7.1

  Transcript of the pitch

  Welcome everyone, we are Elevate Team and we’re going to present Campo
  Rapido, which is our new digital solution for revolutionizing sports facility bookings. First of all, we’re going to present the problem and as we can see, this
  problem of bookings, sports facilities, it’s both a problem from the client side,
  so the people that want to book for playing and the people that manage the
  facilities. In our case, we’re going to focus for the people that are managing the
  facilities and as we can see on the top, we have this little figure that represents
  the person that is in charge.
  So right now we have disconnected calendars, plank interfaces and lack of
  insights, that’s main problems, mainly because all the bookings is done manually
  and on paper, so these problems are a consequential part of it. So what we
  propose? We propose the solution, which is a digital platform, which is called
  Campo Rapido and it’s a digital booking platform, so basically the person that
  is in charge of the fields is able to manage all the bookings on his phone or
  laptop and is going to have an advanced algorithm that basically displays some
  dashboard with some insights, basically like money earned or like changing the
  timetable if they have to maintain the field and so on, and this will produce a
  seamless experience for the manager.
  So right now these are all words, basically it’s a method if you feel the experience yourself. Regional booking methods are inefficient, often involving phone
  calls, emails and in-person visits. The sports field booking system is problematic
  due to the owner’s frequent availability and reliance on a paper-based system.
  We need to explore digital alternatives for smoother operations. Facilities lose
  revenue due to underutilized resources and lost booking. Unreliable booking processes leading to confusion and frustration of the facility owners. They deserve a
  streamlined transparent process. Campo Rapido is here, revolutionizing sports
  field bookings, digital booking platform, just a seamless experience, connecting
  sports facilities with athletes, real-time availability and secure payments.

  Rideshare

  8.1

  Transcript

  Okay, so let’s start. Good morning, we are the Blue.team and today we are
  going to present our product, Rideshare, and we would like to start with a short
  video. Okay, so let’s start. Okay, so let’s start. So, as we’ve seen from the
  video, moving inside the city can be a struggle for many different reasons, and
  even if you own a car and you don’t have this problem, then there are other
  issues that occur, such as spending a lot of time stuck in traffic or searching
  for a parking spot, and there are expenses for fuel and car maintenance. Of
  course, these problems occur mainly in areas where the public transportation
  and or the bike infrastructures are lacking or in existence, because if you live in
  Bolsan you don’t have this problem, and in those areas then also the problem of
  traffic and of searching for parking is increased. Yeah, so we decided we wanted
  to propose a ridesharing solution, and this is meant mainly for short distances
  and possibly repeated commutes, and you have two sides, so on the rider’s side
  you would be able to book a ride from a list of verified users, whereas from
  the driver’s side you would be able to publish your ride and therefore monetize
  commutes that you would perform anyway, and the magic is that it’s of course
  all in one place, so you have one platform to do finding, publishing, verifying,
  in-app payment, you don’t have to use many platforms for that, and of course
  the way we want to monetize this is by using a transaction-based model, so
  we would collect a 10% fee off of the transactions from the rider’s side, and of
  course we want to monetize our insights and our data to help local businesses.
  15

  So our main competitors are Efficient Town Management, because of course
  if you have a bus that works very well, and if you can ride around the city
  with your bike then you don’t need our service. There are other companies, for
  example BlaBlaCar, that offer car-sharing, carpooling services, but those are
  aimed for long-distance commutes. So to validate our idea we created, as for
  an MVP, two spotted-like Instagram pages, and we’ve learned that doing social
  media is very time-consuming and requires a lot of effort. However, there are
  other spotted-like accounts that are mainly focused on university environments,
  and in those accounts there are a lot of requests on a weekly basis asking for
  commutes, or searching for rides, or offering rides. So also those validate our
  assumption for these needs. So I’m Fabio. And I’m Gianluca with the Blue Dog
  team. We thank you for your attention, and of course we invite you to engage
  with us on our platforms. Thank you.

  Corptech

  Transcript

  Gentlemen, I see we’re a little bit tired. So yeah, Qualtech, that’s Qualtech. We
  are a software company that aims to deliver the most cutting edge industrial
  monitoring solutions for companies. Our first use case that we’re presenting
  today is specifically focused on methane leak detection. Companies around the
  world are losing billions of dollars due to methane leaks. But aside from financial losses, it also has a severe impact on our environments and our ecology. So
  to this day, about 30% of global warming is attributed to methane emissions.
  What is our solution? Our solution is an AI and software bundle that integrates
  seamlessly with the latest optical gas imaging technology, which allows the companies to easily quantify the leak, detect it earlier, and provide 24-7 monitoring.
  The market size for this solution is immense and it continues to grow. Worldwide, the market for industrial monitoring is estimated at around 18 billion US
  dollars, but it continues to grow at a steady rate of around 11, 12%. For the
  first five years, we want to focus specifically on methane gas and we expect to
  make off of that around, well, over a million euro by year five in revenue. So
  we’ve already introduced the product, the Duriq. Here’s a tablet where you
  can get familiar with the interface. Look around, play around with it. And the
  best part is we already have traction. We have a global distribution partner,
  Pyram Gamitalia, who are willing to buy our licensing for 600 euro per license
  per camera. And we’ve already, and we’ve spoken with one of the largest gas
  companies in Germany, and they said that they are piloting a similar solution.
  So there’s a clear demand, there’s a clear need for what we’re trying to solve.
  We’re a team of five, but we are looking for AI and machine learning experts.
  There is massive competition in the market. There are three main companies
  who control most of the market at the moment, but we estimate that because
  we are optimizing due to our accuracy and due to process optimization, we can
  save our customers anywhere from 180,000 euro to over a million euro annually.
  Some key metrics. We believe that as soon as we start retailing 282 licenses
  per annum, we’re going to start operating at a break-even level. We expect to
  generate a total revenue of over 1 million annually by year 10. And by year
  six, when we enter the wider industrial monitoring market, we would have a
  retail earnings of 60,000. Our starting price, we’re going to start off with a flat
  fee of 600 euro per camera per license. But in year six, we plan to shift to a
  SaaS model when we start operating in a wider market. We need 100,000, we
  need 190,000 euro. Most of it will go to research and development and labor
  expenses, because that’s based on the comparables analysis that we did during
  our research. And for the first five years, we don’t need to retain Salesforce
  because, well, we have a partner who can go out and do it.

  Great, so I will take over now to tell you a little bit more about AssistMe. My
  name is Tytti, I’m the CEO of AssistMe and I am very excited to share you
  about our product. You can go to the next slide. And the next one from here.
  So AssistMe is a new kind of enterprise productivity app and our mission is to
  reduce the mental load to increase productivity by helping people stay on their
  tasks and making it easier for them to manage their professional and private
  life. So we’re more geared towards these busy professionals that are having a
  hard time managing all of their calendars, all of their assignments and this is
  what we are here to do. So for the problems, what we have seen validated by our
  18

  survey data is that a lot of people still struggle with managing their meetings,
  prioritizing their tasks, staying on top of their goals and planning their day-today life and we are here to provide a solution for that. So what our product
  is going to do is to provide you with smarter ways to schedule your meetings
  and create follow-ups, also providing automated transcripts for you to take the
  mental load off of creating meeting notes and for you to share and customize
  your calendars and adjust your availability. We’re helping people to also to
  achieve their goals by this AI chat assistant that will make it take the mental
  load off your shoulders and moving it into a smarter way of working. We see
  that there is a huge demand for this service still since a lot of meetings are still
  happening in person in addition to the ones online. For instance, in the US, as
  you can see, there’s almost three meetings per day for a lot of people and many
  people are still using regular paper calendars and we want to provide them with
  a digital first opportunity to manage their time. Looking at the market size,
  we can see that the productivity market is currently valued at 5.7 billion in
  2023 and it’s expected to have a steady growth rate up to 2030. There is still a
  lot of growth happening and this is driven by the digitalization of professional
  and private life. Based on our business model, we offer two different kinds of
  subscriptions. The other one would be a free version with certain limitations
  to the features available and our main focus will be on the enterprise version,
  which is offering 20 users for 350 euros per month and this will also have some
  additional features for our enterprise customers. Of course, the freemium model
  allows you to share your calendar with your loved ones, which makes it easier
  for you to manage your time with your family and keep them up to date with
  your life. What we’re seeing based on our research on our competitors is that
  especially our enterprise model will offer a very wide range of features that are
  not available in the free version.

  So firstly, we wanted to, coming into university, being a first year, facing the
  first problem almost immediately was that disorganization, so currently if you
  look at a university student’s journey when you wake up in the morning and
  you have to figure out what exactly am I meant to do today, you have to go
  to basically 10 different places, five of which work on your phone, three only
  work on your laptop, you’re going to Moodle, you’re going to something else.
  As a basic MVP, we’re trying to organize all of that into one place so that
  you basically have one interface where you know what exactly I have to do on
  today, basically. So currently the existing solutions out there are you have like
  your Google Calendar, your notes, if you look at some of those, that’s what
  my Moodle looked like on a day when I had five classes, sort of. It says I have
  nothing to do. If you switch here, this is where the problem comes in, is that
  there are things that I can add my calendar to, but I have to go through this,
  which is clunky and archaic and something that you really need to sit down
  and have a next level degree of consciousness, conscientiousness to be able to
  do consistently. So instead, we’re shifting this input format into something that
  all of us can do, which is language. So essentially you kind of just tell your app
  the way you would describe it to a chat GPT. Okay, I’ve got this, this and this,
  something you remember on the bus, you just type it in. I’ve got a meeting at
  five o’clock and boom, you have it in your calendar. So we describe it as like
  talking to a friend who listens, remembers, and ultimately helps you get things
  done. This is more of the idealized product, whereas the basic is really, the
  MVP is really just an input in through language and an output out through
  a scheduling app. But eventually down the line, we want to add gamification
  features. We want to integrate with university backends so we can get their
  data and you can kind of import data from Moodle that’s further down the line.
  We want to start in the Finnish market. And given that we are in a

  Shieldskin. My name is Valentin and I’m happy to start now for our presentation. First of all we would look at our product again so you get a closer shot.
  One thing we mentioned in the video that’s very very important is that we’ve
  got protectors on the shoulders, in the back and as well on the elbows and you
  can remove them and wear the jacket in a day-to-day casual environment as
  well. We’ve got more designs. The one on the left is one very special exclusive
  design and you get an impression of our product. Our social mission we mentioned as well. I want to stress that because it’s really important to us. We
  21

  use leather waste to produce new gloves and gift them to people for free here in
  Finland. Looking at our business. First of all riding a motorcycle is extremely
  dangerous so people need protection and they want it as well usually. However
  motorcycle jackets often are very very bulky and are not convenient. You can’t
  wear them in normal environments usually and they tend to be very expensive
  and this is the issue we are solving. Who are our customers? Go back please.
  Our customers are motorcyclists aging 18 to 35 and they want protection and
  as well convenience to wear them in normal day-to-day life and they have a
  sense for style. Our plans. We are starting here in Finland. We’re gonna set
  up the business make it profitable and after presumably one year we’ll expand
  to Sweden building infrastructure for expansion and in the third year we’ll go
  to Europe to the bigger markets. Looking at our financials for the first two
  years we’ll be starting in Finland and then by the end of the first year we hope
  to get a market share of about 2.6% and with a revenue of 314,000 euros we
  are looking to return to our investors 58.9% of the investment with a profit of
  60,602 euros. Then expanding to Sweden by the second year we hope to have a
  combined market share of 4.87% and with a revenue of 950,000 euros returning
  for investors 330% and a profit of 282,000 euros. Now looking at our competitors we have Polo Motorrad and their prices ranges between 350 and 550 euros
  while the jacket maker Diaz ranges between 280 and 350 euros and then what
  stands us apart is affordability. Our product is going to be having a price of
  229.4 euros including VAT and our quality is top-notch and then we have the
  social welfare expert and sustainability attached to it and the team is made up
  of me, the chief

  So, hi everyone. So we are a team of sauna lovers, just like you and me. I’m
  sharing joining me today is Yuga. So, imagine, finding and reserving a unique
  sauna experience as easy as reserving a hotel room on booking.com. That’s
  sauna you and me. It’s a one-stop digital hub for everything sauna, from traditional smoking sauna to floating adventure. But finding, like this one, floating
  sauna, but finding a perfect sauna or just a sauna you want can be a hassle. Like
  Daniel in the video, many face endless hours researching, and skater booking
  system, confusing payment options. There’s no single platform to make everything easy, leaving many sauna lovers like you and me confused, overwhelming,
  and underserved. The solution, sauna you and me is the solution. It’s a super
  app or website, make stop booking and finding sauna easy and simple. You
  can discover, compare, book, pay, all in one single place. It’s faster, it’s user
  friendly, and it’s designed to give you unforgettable sauna experience. In Finland, there are more than 2 million saunas, with 70, 90% of Finns using sauna
  weekly, 40% of them using sauna multiple times per week. And the global sauna
  market is growing. Wellness tourism is a $900 billion industry. According to
  our survey, more than 70% of our responders are eager to book their sauna experience digitally. So we start in Finland, and we are ready to scale worldwide.
  Then our main revenue stream would be commission fee, as our competitors
  or similar platforms are also doing. And we would also include listing fees as
  like a premium package for having like more visibility. And then other revenue
  stream would be advertisement shown in our site. And comparing us to our
  competitors, they usually don’t have integrated bookings or doesn’t cover all
  types of saunas in one place. They have like one type only or might be limited
  to only capital region in Finland. And they have, all of them only have like
  web page and they have like no mobile app. And some of them even lacking
  English version, many of them have, but some of them are lacking still. And
  presenting our team. So Shirin is our CEO and kind of ideator behind of this.
  And Daniel is our CMO and I’m CFO. And Anja is our CTO. And here’s how

  23

  some projections, how we will grow. And we are expected that we will make
  profit third year. So we’ll be realistic with that. That’s the main key takeaway
  here. And what are we seeking? We are seeking funding for 55,000 seed funding
  in exchange of 10% equity, which will help us scale the platform further. And
  we are looking at partnerships like local sauna providers and tourism boards
  to enhance our offerings. And we are also looking team members like customer
  specialists and data analysts. And kind of, yeah, more people, people with more
  knowledge basically. And that’s it. Thank you.

  Transcript

  So, everybody, welcome to MatchIT, revolutionary recruitment platform for IT
  companies. What was the idea behind? We all face this situation when there is
  limited HR resources, inaccurate job requirements, and in this way, hiring becoming a very risky process. You don’t understand everything what companies
  want from you and companies, in turn, do not understand what to expect from
  people. And this is a big problem. Solution? MatchIT. It is a platform for job
  seekers to show their real skill level and confirm it. MatchIT provides skill-based
  evaluation of candidates and MatchIT brings trust between candidates because
  companies will be able to see their real skills and real experience. And in turn,
  for companies, because the people will be able to see the trusted reviews for the
  companies and their real offerings and not the lies you can find, for instance,
  on other platforms. Market is very big and most importantly, it’s very scalable.
  Only on the Finnish market, there is 137,000 employees in the ICT sector and
  33,000 new hirings in 2023. It is an amazing scalability for EU market because
  there is 9.8 million specialists in the ICT sector. Now let’s take a look what does
  it mean to us? How can we bring money? How can we bring value? The value
  is brought by the experience and understanding of the situation. We’ve been
  asking people from different industries like HR, coders and also developers and
  they showed that there is a need for the platform where everything is united.
  All services under one ecosystem and problem extend well to selling consultants
  and it will be very easy to compare skills directly. So there is an old way of
  hiring. There is DooneyTory and Jobly where you can see the ads and that’s
  mostly it. And there is a new way of hiring, the LeadCode and HackerRank
  and others, where you can access skills of employees, but at the same time, you
  can ensure there is no connection between them. And in this way, the combined
  way is MatchIT, when there is both confirmed skills and information about the
  work and links. So the process, for instance, for DooneyTory to hire one person
  for the company costs 2,500 euros. We are offering a cost cap of 1,000 euros and
  in three years, we’re aiming for a minimum market share of 1.5% in Finland,
  around 500 persons per year. And in this case, after four years, our net present
  value will exceed 300,000 euros. Amazing numbers. And the scalability after
  these three years to the European market shows great results. And our fantastic
  team of four people of Emil, Matvei, Heikki and Joel is happy to invite you to
  invest into our project. We ask for 15,000 euros and we are ready to bargain,
  offering 10% of the share in our company. But this is just the start. So you can
  see what we want and how we’ll implement it. So the decision is yours. Thank
  you.

  We are PolyGlobe and we are here to change the way people learn languages.
  Imagine stepping into a virtual cafe in Paris or navigating a train station in
  Tokyo all while practicing a local language. With PolyGlobe we bring immersive
  gamified learning experiences to life, making language learning more effective,
  engaging, and fun. So language learning today has three big problems. First,
  learners often struggle to imply what they have learned in real life. Second,
  speaking a new language can feel intimidating, creating a fear of making mistakes. And third, most methods today are hard and boring, leading many to
  quit before they achieve fluency. So our solution is PolyGlobe, a VR-based app
  that transforms language learning into an immersive adventure. We already
  created a rough prototype and we are ready to bring this to the global market
  with a lot of languages. Market size and opportunity. The language learning
  market is booming, valued at $61.5 billion in 2023 and expected to double by
  2031. Meanwhile, VR in education, worth $3.8 billion in 2023, is growing at
  an impressive 18% annually. PolyGlobe stands at the intersection of these two
  trends, offering an immersive gamified solution for students, travelers, with millions seeking better ways to learn languages. And the opportunity is vast and
  growing. Okay, and on this slide you can see a quick overview of our team.
  Then you can go on to the next slide. PolyGlobe operates in a competitive
  space with huge players like Duolingo and many others. However, what sets
  us apart is the immersive VR experience that places learners directly into realworld scenarios, encouraging them to speak the language. Then you can go on
  to the next slide. While competitors like Duolingo gamify language learning,
  PolyGlobe goes a step further by incorporating social features, allowing users
  to practice in a virtual community. This creates a more engaging and practical
  learning environment which traditional apps can’t offer. Yeah, and then here
  31

  you can see a matrix on where we are compared to our competitors. Then the
  next slide. In our first year, we aim to reach 30,000 users, leveraging the growing
  VR adoption rate of 120 million global users. With a planned ramp-up growth
  model, our first-year revenue is estimated at 49,000. On the cost side, initial
  platform and app development will require 300,000, followed by 50,000 monthly
  updates and hosting expenses. Overall first-year costs total to 420,000. We are
  confident that with user acquisition growth, we’ll achieve a strong foundation
  for scaling revenue and impact. We are seeking 500,000 in funding for software
  development, launching a marketing campaign, and to acquire users. Our key
  milestones include launching a beta within six months, acquiring 30,000 users
  in year one, and scaling our immersive scenarios. PolyGlobe is positioned at
  the cutting edge of VR education.

  Transcript

  Today, Paul and I want to present Mediflow. So first, maybe some of you experience some of those pains when taking medicine. First, you are ill, you go
  to your medicine cabinet and you see, okay, the medicine that I want to take
  is expired. Next, when you found another medicine, you have to read through
  long descriptions in order to get to know how you have to consume the medicine.
  And finally, a few days later, you realize, okay, I forgot to take the pill in the
  morning. And the solution is Mediflow, and you just got to know our application through the video. So let’s have a look at the market. So actually, there’s a
  big market potential. On the left side, you can see the average pharmaceutical
  spendings of countries in Central Europe. And you can see that Germany is in
  the lead. And there’s also a quite big growth potential. There are also current
  trends that are beneficial for our Mediflow idea. First, people are getting older.
  And older people tend to have more illnesses. And also older people are becoming more familiar with the smartphones. Next, there’s also a health grant going
  on in Central Europe. And people consume more supplements. So our revenue
  streams will be affiliate links to online pharmacies. There will be premium features, as mentioned in the video. For example, you can book an appointment
  with health professionals. And there will also be in-app advertisement. So let’s
  have a look at our team. So our team consists of three motivated persons with
  backgrounds in business and also in IT. However, we need a programmer and
  also a UI designer to launch our startup. Let’s have a look at the competition.
  So actually, there are already pill notification apps. There are online pharmacies where you can buy the medicine. And there are also apps where you can
  book online appointments with health professionals. However, we are the all-inone solution. So our app combines all these features. And on addition to those
  features, we also have expiration tracking. People can see the medicine information, the most important medicine information at a glance. They can buy the
  medicine at the best price through affiliate links to several online pharmacies.
  And there will also be AI features. For example, you can take a picture of your
  prescription. And there will be automatically a treatment plan added to your
  user account. Okay, so this is our financial strategy. These indicators show how
  we are becoming profitable. While our cumulative cash flow starts negative due
  to investment in marketing and development, we reached the breakeven point
  between month 11 and month 12. Regarding the cash flow sufficiency index, we
  can see that even at the lowest point around month 7, we still are able to cover
  our operating costs of the next months. MediFlow is more than an investment
  opportunity. It’s a way to transform the healthcare market. We are operating on a fast-growing market with a result of real traction. We are looking for
  €250,000 that we will spend about 60% in marketing, 40% in development, and
  10in results. With your support, we aim to multiply your investments by five
  within five years. MediFlow is ready. We have the vision, we have the team,
  and we have the market. All we need is you. Invest in MediFlow today and

  and we are bringing data-driven decision-making to forests, fields and farms
  with the help of growth. To increase production from forests, crop use from
  farms and efficiently managing land, gathering a single land level data is the
  direction forestry and agriculture industry are going towards. However, there
  is a large group of forest owners and farmers that are lacking information and
  they do not have enough financial resources to actively start using these trending
  technologies. And we are educating them, showing the actual value as well as
  34

  being part of these communities. Our service will offer a service without the
  customer not needing any equipment themselves and our end product will be
  easy to understand suggestions and reports based on their area and problematic
  parts especially. And additionally, we will be involving drone hobbyists around
  the country to start actively capturing data from their hometowns to send us
  for analysis. We will be focusing on the Finnish market which has a lot of
  potential. In our survey, over 60% of the landowners were interested in starting
  to use these kind of technology in their operations. And the average customer
  was already willing to pay over 750 euros per year, even though they didn’t
  have any additional knowledge on the topic yet. So the traction for the first
  one and two months we’re planning the idea, now pitching it, then moving on
  to the marketing and portfolio building phase. And the idea is that for the
  first six months we do it basically for free, planning to build reputation and our
  portfolio. And then after that six months we start to do the payment-based
  services and scaling up in that sense and then during the off-season we would
  diversify. There’s our team which I would compress as a strong team with lots of
  talent. There’s the competition and the main competition is divided into three
  parts. So the private drone pilots, the precision farming solutions and then the
  large companies and traditional tech solutions. And there’s a list of the other
  competition more specified and then the stuff that we bring in. So reliability,
  ease of use, low cost, clear pricing, customization of services and value. This
  is according to our CFO. So one year or full year in operation we’d have four
  employees, 163 customers. The set price is 21.3 euros per hectare and the
  revenue of 170 000, which means a 23 profit margin. And we’re looking for an
  investment of 150 000 euros. We’re supporting Finnish nature, food production,
  agriculture and yeah. Thank you. Okay, so now we have...

  he presentation. As you saw in the video, we are a platform which connects
  service providers with service seekers. Minna is here. She’s going to talk about
  Pursealtest features, market opportunities, and some overview on our competitors. Minna, please. Yeah. Hi, everyone. So, everyday customers struggle and
  waste time to find reliable local professionals. While service providers face low
  visibility and inefficient tools, the booming service economy is held back by fragmented platforms that fail to connect them seamlessly. So, Pursealta is a unified
  marketplace for all types of professionals. For customers, we provide a place to
  find professionals locally, to book appointments easily, post service requests,
  and give reviews. Professionals can create detailed profiles, take an access to a
  booking system, and they can receive customer requests and generate quotes.
  And Finland is the perfect launch market for Pursealta. The Finnish service
  economy is worth over 40 billion annually. There are over 300,000 small service
  providers and freelancers in Finland alone. If we capture only 1% of Finland’s
  service providers, 3,000 users, we could generate over 360,000 euros annually
  from subscriptions alone. Our competitors are focused only on specific fields,
  for example, beauty care or renovations. We serve all industries and professionals. We are affordable for small businesses. Our model is easily scalable and...
  Yeah, sorry. And Aras will tell you more about our earning models. Thank
  you, Minna, for the excellent introduction to Pursealta, its features and market
  opportunities. Now, let me take you through our revenue model and explain
  why Pursealta is a solid investment. Pursealta’s revenue model is designed to
  be simple, scalable, and sustainable. So, in the first year, we plan to take just
  a hundred professional accounts. We expect to generate approximately about
  16,000 euros in the revenue from subscriptions, bids, and bookings. By the second year, if we go through 500 professionals, the total revenue could reach about
  95,700 euros annually. So, why do we need your support? To bring Pursealta
  to life and make it successful, we need your support to finalize our platform
  development, execute marketing, and execute targeted marketing campaigns to
  attract some service providers and also customers. And our third goal is to
  expand our platform’s reach. So, with just 10,000 euros in funding, we can
  unlock the 40 million Finnish service economy and set Pursealta on a path to
  become a trusted platform for local services. Here’s our team. Our team brings
  a diverse set of skills and shared passion for solving this problem. Together,
  we’re committed to making Pursealta a game-changing platform for local services in Finland and beyond. Thank you all for your attention and time. With
  Pursealta, we’re building a solution that simplifies connections and empowers
  local service providers. We welcome your questions and your feedback if you
  got any. Thank you.
